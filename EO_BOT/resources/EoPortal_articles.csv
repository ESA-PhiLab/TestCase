The objective is to characterize the physical properties of impact fragments to improve satellite breakup models and space situational awareness. The DebriSat project will update and expand upon the information obtained in the 1992 SOCIT (Satellite Orbital Debris Characterization Impact Test), which characterized the breakup of a 1960's US Navy Transit satellite. There are three phases to this project: the design and fabrication of DebriSat - an engineering model representing a modern, 60 cm/50 kg class LEO satellite; conduction of a laboratory-based hypervelocity impact to catastrophically break up the satellite; and characterization of the properties of breakup fragments down to 2 mm in size. The data obtained, including fragment size, area-to-mass ratio, density, shape, material composition, optical properties, and radar cross-section distributions, will be used to supplement the DoD's and NASA's satellite breakup models to better describe the breakup outcome of a modern satellite. A key element to provide good short- and long-term OD (Orbital Debris) environment definition and OD impact risk assessments for critical space assets is the ability to reliably predict the outcome of a satellite breakup. The two major classes of satellite breakups are explosions and collisions. Before the anti-satellite test on the FengYun 1-C (FY-1C) weather"

After the FY-1C event and the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 in 2009, the numbers of the catalogued explosion fragments and collision fragments were about equal. Based on various modelling projection studies of the debris environments in low Earth orbit (LEO, the region below 2000 km altitude), collision fragments are expected to dominated the environment in the future – a phenomenon known as the ""Kessler Syndrome"" and predicted by Kessler and Cour-Palais in 1978. Background: A satellite breakup model consists of three fundamental components – fragment size, A/M (Area-to-Mass ratio), and relative velocity (ΔV) distributions. The fragment size distribution quantifies the amount of fragments generated from the event and the ΔV distribution specifies the initial spread of the fragment cloud. The A/M distribution determines the solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag perturbations on the fragments. The latter is directly related to the orbital lifetimes of fragments below about 1000 km altitude. These three components provide the key information to model the orbital evolution of fragments and their short and long-term distributions, including spatial density, velocity distribution, and flux, in the near-Earth environment. For spacecraft (S/C) OD impact damage assessments, additional information, such as the shape and material density of the impacting debris, is needed to improve the reliability of the assessments. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) provides tracking data and maintains a catalog for the large objects in the near-Earth space. The size limits for the catalogued objects"

The size information of a tracked debris can be inferred from its RCS (Radar Cross Section). The A/M of a LEO debris below 1000 km altitude can also be estimated based on the atmospheric drag perturbations on its orbital history. For smaller debris, however, no such data exist. Because of the high impact speed in LEO (with an average of 10 km/s), even a sub-millimeter debris could be a safety concern for human space activities and robotic missions. Laboratory-based satellite impact experiments, therefore, are necessary to provide data for the physical properties of fragments smaller than 10 cm. To characterize the outcome of a satellite collision and the properties of the generated fragments, the DoD (Department of Defense) and NASA conducted several series of laboratory impact tests in the 1980's and the early 1990's. One of the test series, the SOCIT (Satellite Orbital Debris Characterization Impact Test), led to a key laboratory-based dataset used in the development of the current NASA and DoD satellite breakup models. These models have been used for various orbital debris applications for more than 10 years. The target used for SOCIT was a flight-ready Navy Transit navigation satellite (46 cm diameter by 30 cm height, 34.5 kg) fabricated in the 1960's. As materials, components, and construction techniques for satellite design and fabrication continue to advance, there is a need to conduct new impact experiments on targets more representative of the modern satellites. The data can be used"

The responsibilities of the ODPO are to provide project and technical oversight and lead the efforts for data collection, analyses, and NASA model improvements. The DebriSat project is co-sponsored by the Air Force's SMC (Space and Missile Systems Center). The SMC team provides technical oversight, supports data analyses, and leads the effort for DoD model improvements. The design and fabrication of DebriSat are led by UF (University of Florida) with subject matter experts' support provided by the Aerospace Corporation. The UF team also leads the post-impact fragment collection and measurements. The hypervelocity impact destruction of DebriSat will be conducted at the AEDC (Arnold Engineering Development Complex) of the USAF, located at Arnold AFB, Tennessee. Design of DebriSat: DebriSat is intended to be representative of modern LEO satellites. To achieve traditional improvements over the SOCIT test series, DebriSat is 45% more massive than Transit. It is also covered with MLI and equipped with deployable solar panels. Table 1 provides a comparison between DebriSat and Transit. The design of DebriSat started with a survey of LEO satellites launched between 1997 and 2011. Based on the availability of the data, 50 representative satellites were selected for analysis. Common subsystem, materials, mass fractions, structure, and construction methods of the sample satellites were identified.

The ADCS subsystem includes two star trackers, four sun sensors, one inertial measurement unit, one magnetometer, the magnetorquers, four reaction wheels, and one avionics module. The C&DH subsystem includes a flight computer, one data recorder, and cables inside shielded boxes. The EPS includes mock-up batteries, one power management and distribution module, and three deployable solar panels (30 cm x 50 cm each). The DebriSat payloads consist of two spectrometers and one optical imager. The propulsion subsystem includes one COVP (Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel), three thruster pairs, and one plumbing system. This is based on the assumption that future payloads will be in compliance with the post-mission passivation guideline adopted by the international community. The TT&C includes on S-band antenna, one X-band antenna, two UHF/VHF omnidirectional antennas, and avionics boxes. The thermal management subsystem is based on the capillary pump loop design. It includes one thermal reservoir, heat pipes, Kapton heaters. MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) will also be used to wrap some components and cover most of the exterior of DebriSat. To reduce the cost of the project, a decision was made to emulate the majority of the components. The emulated components were based on existing designs of flight hardware, including dimensions, materials, and connection mechanisms. The designs of the emulated components were reviewed by subject matter experts to ensure the quality of the products. For example, the DebriSat design includes four reaction wheels in the ADCS.

Similar to the SOCIT tests, to exceed this EMR threshold for DebriSat, the hypervelocity impact has to be carried out at the AEDC facility. The AEDC Range G Complex maintains and operates the largest two stage light gas gun in the United States. The range has several launchers capable of accelerating 500 g projectiles up the 7 km/s or 15 kg projectiles up to 3 km/s. The target is placed inside the 3 m diameter cylinder range tank (Figure 6). The projectile selected for DebriSat impact is an aluminum sphere with a minimum diameter of 5 cm and a mass of 176 g. The impact speed is planned for 7 km/s. The expected EMR is 86 J/g. The Range G launcher is a two-stage, light-gas gun that is capable of launching various types of projectiles at velocities up to 7 km/s. The facility is routinely launches projectiles at velocities between 3-6 km/s. Projectiles up to 203 mm in diameter are launched into a 3 m diameter, 283.5 m long instrumented tank that can be maintained at pressures from 0.2 torr to 1.7 atmospheres.

Currently the facility has three sizes of interchangeable barrels: 84 mm , 102 mm, and 203 mm. The range tank is equipped with several diagnostic instruments. They include X-ray systems with 2 µs intervals between frames, high speed CCD cameras, and options for additional systems, such as laser, to record the impact process and to potentially collect data for ΔV measurements for some of the fragments immediately after the impact. An option to install low-mass piezoelectric sensors inside DebriSat to measure the propagation of shockwaves during breakup is also being considered. Low density foam panels will be installed inside the target range as illustrated in Figure 7. The purpose is to ""soft catch"" fragments after the impact and to protect the chamber. Polyurethane from stacks, consisting of panels of different densities (0.06, 0.096, and 0.192 g/cm3) and with a total thickness of up to 25 cm, were used during the SOCIT test series. For DebriSat, new foam materials and configuration will be adopted to capture fragments, reduce damage to the fragments, and to allow for easy extraction of fragments from the panels for post-test measurements.

Fragments characterization plan: After the hypervelocity impact on DebriSat, fragments down to ~ 2 mm in size will be collected and identified individually.

The second part of the measurements will include the selection of sample representative fragments. Those fragments will be subjected to additional three-dimensional digital scanning for more accurate cross-sectional area and volume data. Additional radar, photometric, and spectral measurements on selected fragments are also planned to provide data for the development of the optical size estimation model and potential improvements to the existing NASA radar size estimation model."
0,DebriSat,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/debrisat,EoPortal,EoPortal,Automated Imaging System 1,"Automated Imaging System One of the ways that satellite breakup models characterize fragments is by size. The standard parameter for size characterization of orbital debris used by NASA is characteristic length. Characteristic length is defined as the mean of an object's three maximum orthogonal projected lengths. This provides a single length parameter used to describe the size of a fragment. Originally, characteristic length was measured by hand using calipers and graph paper. This measurement approach was time-consuming and relied on inconsistent human measurement. The next improvement in measurement was to utilize a 3D scanner and manually measure the resulting model in computer software. While this improved repeatability and traceability, the human factor was still present in measurements and the process took hours per object. The automated imaging system that has been developed will provide quick, accurate, and repeatable characteristic length measurements. An automated imaging system was developed for the size characterization of the debris fragments. The system uses images taken from various azimuth and elevation angles around the object to produce a 3D representation of the fragment via a space carving algorithm. The system consists of N point-and-shoot cameras attached to a rigid support structure that defines the elevation angle for each camera. The debris fragment is placed on a turntable that is incrementally rotated to desired azimuth angles. The number of images acquired can be varied based on the desired resolution. Appropriate background and lighting is used for ease of object detection. The system calibration and image acquisition process are automated to result in push-button"

However, for quality assurance reasons, the system is semi-autonomous by design to ensure operator involvement. A description provided of the imaging system setup, calibration procedure, repeatability analysis, and the results of the debris characterization. Image Acquisition Instrumentation: The imaging system has the instrumentation necessary to acquire images from various azimuth and elevation angles around the object. These images will then be used to generate a 3D point cloud of the object. As shown in Figure 10, the system currently features six point-and-shoot cameras, a rigid support structure, a rotary turntable, a green screen background, and diffuse lighting. The system also features a desktop computer to automate image acquisition, detect the object in images, perform 3D reconstruction via a space carving algorithm, measure the characteristic length of the point cloud, and store the images and measurement results. The cameras, which are equidistant from the center of the turntable, are rigidly fixed to the support structure to preserve calibration. Images can be acquired from around the object by rotating the turntable to various azimuth angles while acquiring images from various elevation angles. The green screen and diffuse lighting are used to aid in object detection in the images. In order to create a 3D representation, the object must be detected in each acquired image. To aid with object detection, a green screen background and diffuse lighting are used (Figure 11). The green screen provides a background against which the object can be easily distinguished. The diffuse lighting is used to eliminate shadows in the images. The system"

A sample object image is shown in Figure 12. System operation: An algorithm that automates the image acquisition process was developed. Through a single command from the user in the graphical user interface (Figure 5), images from each elevation are acquired, the turntable is incremented to the next azimuth, and the process is repeated until images from all azimuth positions are acquired. The system is controlled such that the turntable increments to the next azimuth angle only once all cameras have acquired images from each of their elevation angles. Currently, images are acquired at six elevation angles and 21 azimuth angles. The first and last azimuth angles are made to be the same. As a result, the first and last image for each camera can then be compared to confirm that the object has not moved during imaging. The turntable acceleration is limited to reduce the risk of object movement relative to the turntable during imaging, which would reduce accuracy. It takes about four minutes to acquire the 126 images currently used for 3D reconstruction. Camera calibration: To reconstruct the images into a single 3D representation, the imaging system must be calibrated. The camera calibration is performed by acquiring images of a calibration checkerboard pattern of known size (Figure 14). The automated imaging sequence is run to acquire images from each azimuth and elevation angle. These images are then processed to detect the corners in"
0,DebriSat,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/debrisat,EoPortal,EoPortal,Automated Imaging System 4,"the checkerboard pattern. Once the corners are detected in each image, the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters for each of the cameras are extracted. Using the extrinsic parameters, which give location and orientation information for the cameras, the images can be reconstructed into a single 3D representation of the object. Using the intrinsic parameters, the object size in the image can be related to its physical size. With a rigid camera setup and a precise turntable, the calibration will still be valid after numerous objects are imaged. Testing will be conducted to experimentally determine the number of cycles over which calibration is preserved. The system must be calibrated to within the desired measurement accuracy for all objects imaged. When the imaging system is in use, calibration will be required after a fixed number of objects are imaged. At the very least, calibration will be conducted at the beginning of every day regardless of the number of objects processed the previous day. In addition, a calibration sphere of known diameter (Figure 15) will be imaged to ensure the measurement results are within the required accuracy. Performance of the imaging system: The imaging system was developed for size characterization of debris fragments from the DebriSat project. With the system, an object's characteristic length can be quickly and accurately determined. The system is fully automated to eliminate the human factor from measurements. The non-contact measurements also reduce fragment handling and the risk of fragment damage. The imaging system is intended to generate a 3D point cloud representation of the object"

A space carving algorithm is used to accomplish 3D reconstruction from the silhouette of the object seen in images taken from various azimuth and elevation angles around the object. The use of the silhouette for reconstruction ensures that the maximum dimensions are captured. In addition, the space carving approach reduces processing time by disregarding features that are irrelevant for characteristic length measurement. For this reason, the space carving approach does not detect concave features in faces of the object. However, these concavities are irrelevant for characteristic length measurement. A variety of test samples have been processed using the imaging system. The samples tested have varied in size from maximum dimensions of 2 mm to 100 mm. The test objects have had a variety of shapes, colors, and reflectivities. The results from one of the test samples processed is shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17. Currently, objects with characteristic lengths as small as 2 mm can be imaged and detected. The characteristic length results have shown an accuracy of about 2% and a repeatability of about 1.5%. These accuracy and repeatability values will be refined as further testing is completed. The measurement accuracy was verified through comparison with existing approaches for characteristic length measurement, such as hand measurements with calipers and NASA 3D scanner measurements. The measurement results were also compared to the known dimensions of computer-generated point clouds. In order to measure repeatability, the imaging system was used to measure the same object repeatedly. The"

In summary, a fully automated imaging system has been developed for characteristic length measurement of DebriSat hypervelocity impact fragments. The imaging system is currently capable of acquiring a total of 126 images from six elevation angles and 21 azimuth angles. This image acquisition process can be completed with a single button-click and only takes about 4 minutes. Once these images are acquired, a 3D representation of the object can be generated and measured in about 2 minutes. Thus, the imaging system provides a complete approach for producing a 3D representation of an object from which characteristic length can then be measured."

The challenge throughout the project has been to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the characteristics of each fragment. To this end, the post hypervelocity-impact test activities, which include fragment collection, extraction, and characterization, have been designed to minimize handling of the fragments. The procedures for fragment collection, extraction, and characterization were painstakingly designed and implemented to maintain the post-impact state of the fragments, thus ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the characterization data. Each process is designed to expedite the accumulation of data, however, the need for speed is restrained by the need to protect the fragments. Methods to expedite the process such as parallel processing have been explored and implemented while continuing to maintain the highest integrity and value of the data. To minimize fragment handling, automated systems have been developed and implemented. Errors due to human inputs are also minimized by the use of these automated systems. - In order to characterize the DebriSat fragments, a rigorous process was developed and implemented.

Once panel preparation is completed, the panels are X-ray imaged. After the X-ray images are acquired, they are post-processed to detect other embedded fragments. The extraction task involves the careful extraction of fragments with at least one dimension greater than 2 mm which are stored individually. The approximate location of each fragments on or in the panel is recorded to provide information on physical distribution and penetration depth. The fragments are recorded into the DebriSat Categorization System (DCS) database where each fragment is given a unique identification number. The characterization task involves fragment assessments (2D/3D size discriminator, material, shape, and color), measurements (mass and physical size XDIM, YDIM, and ZDIM), and the size characteristics from the measurements (i.e., determining the characteristic length, average cross-sectional area, and volume) are calculated. All the fragment data and images generated throughout the process as well as the associated metadata (revision history, creator, timestamp, etc.) are all uploaded and stored on the DCS. Once the fragments are characterized, each fragment goes through a verification process where technicians confirm the data archived in the DCS database. The fragment verification ensures the integrity of the fragment data generated throughout the post-HVI (Hypervelocity Impact) process. In addition, Gage repeatability and reproducibility (Gage R&R) tests are conducted every 1,000 verified fragments to quantify the variations in equipment and procedure.

A verification step has been implemented in order to mitigate inaccuracies in the information stored in the database and to ensure the integrity of the data archived for each fragment. There has been a steady increase in the panel preparation for X-ray imaging and object detection and completed all the panels that are greater than 2/3 of the original size.

To protect the fragments resulting from the impact tests, ""soft-catch"" arenas made of polyurethane foam panels were utilized. After each impact test, the test chamber was cleaned and debris resulting from the catastrophic demise of the test article were collected and shipped to the University of Florida for post-impact processing. The post-impact processing activities include collecting, characterizing, and cataloging of the fragments. Since the impact tests, a team of students has been working to characterize the fragments in terms of their mass, size, shape, color and material content. The focus of the 20 months since the impact tests has been on the collection of 2 mm and larger fragments resulting from impact test on the 56 kg representative LEO satellite referred to as DebriSat.

The team includes researchers from the University of California San Diego (UCSD), Michigan State University, Idaho National Laboratory, and the General Motors Research and Development Center. - Using lithium metal to replace the graphite for battery anodes is the ultimate goal for part of the battery R&D field; these lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) have the potential to double the capacity of today’s best lithium-ion technologies. For example, lithium metal battery-powered electric vehicles would have twice the range of lithium-ion battery-powered vehicles, for the same battery weight. - Despite this advantage over lithium-ion batteries, LMBs are not considered a viable option to power electric vehicles or electronics, because of their short lifespan and potential safety hazards, specifically short circuits caused by lithium dendrite growth. Researchers and technologists had noticed that subjecting LMBs to pressure during battery cycling increases performance and stability, helping to solve this lifespan challenge. But the reasons behind this were not fully understood. - The researchers used several characterizations and imaging techniques to study LMB morphology and quantify performance when the batteries were subjected to different pressures. They found that higher pressure levels force lithium particles to deposit in neat columns, without any porous spaces in between. The pressure required to achieve this result is 350 kilo"

By contrast, batteries subjected to lower levels of pressure are porous and lithium particles deposit in a disorderly fashion, leaving room for dendrites to grow. They also showed that the process doesn’t affect the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure of the batteries’ electrolytes. - Another way to boost performance is to not completely discharge the battery while it cycles. Instead, the researchers keep a reservoir of lithium where re-nucleation can occur. These findings were validated at the General Motors Research and Development Center in Michigan. - Separately, researchers at Idaho National Laboratory used molecular dynamics simulations to understand the stack pressure range used in this work, which is much less than that expected based on macroscopic mechanical models. • November 22, 2021: Scientists at the University of Birmingham (UK) have succeeded in creating an experimental model of an elusive kind of fundamental particle called a skyrmion in a beam of light. - The breakthrough provides physicists with a real system demonstrating the behaviour of skyrmions, first proposed 60 years ago by a University of Birmingham mathematical physicist, Professor Tony Skyrme. - Skyrme’s idea used the structure of spheres in 4-dimensional space to guarantee the indivisible nature of a skyrmion particle in 3 dimensions. 3D particle-like skyrmions are theorised to tell us about the early origins of the Universe, or about the physics of exotic materials or cold atoms. However, despite being investigated for over 50 years, 3D skyrmions have been seen very rarely in experiments. The most current research into skyrmions focuses"

Although we’re making good progress investigating skyrmions in 2D, we live in a 3D world. We need a system that can model a skyrmion in all its possible states in a way that could be measured. We realised that a beam of light could be harnessed for this purpose because we are able to closely control its properties, and so use it as a platform to model our skyrmions. With this approach, we can start to truly understand these objects and realise their scientific potential.” - To create their model, Dr Danica Sugic and Professor Dennis, in the University’s School of Physics and Astronomy, cast the standard description of light, the polarisation (direction the in which the light waves travel) and phase (the position of the light waves’ vibration) in terms of a sphere in 4-dimensional space, crucial to Skyrme’s original vision. This then allowed the Skyrmion field to be designed and engineered into a beam of laser light in an experiment led by Professor Cornelia Denz, University of Münster. The team used cutting-edge measurements to determine the precise structure of the skyrmion. - “These objects are actually quite intricate,"
0,Technologies,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/technologies,EoPortal,EoPortal,Researchers Determine Optimum Pressure to Improve the Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries 4,"from a geometric point of view,” said Dr Sugic. “They resemble a complex system of interlocking rings, with the whole forming a particle-like structure. What’s particularly interesting is the skyrmion’s topological properties – they can be distorted, stretched or squeezed, but will not come apart. This robustness is one of the properties that scientists are most interested in exploiting.” • September 24, 2021: Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are an unsung hero of the lighting industry. They run efficiently, give off little heat, and last for a long time. Now scientists are looking at new materials to make more efficient and longer-lived LEDs with applications in consumer electronics, medicine, and security. - Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory report that they have prepared stable perovskite nanocrystals for such LEDs. Also contributing to the effort was Academia Sinica in Taiwan. - Perovskites are a class of material that share a particular crystalline structure giving them light-absorbing and light-emitting properties that are useful in a range of energy-efficient applications, including solar cells and various kinds of detectors. Perovskite nanocrystals have been prime candidates as a new LED material but have proved unstable on testing. The research team stabilized the nanocrystals in a porous structure called a metal-organic framework, or MOF for short. Based on earth-abundant materials and fabricated at room temperature, these LEDs could one day enable lower cost TVs and consumer electronics, as well as better gamma-ray imaging devices and even"

R. Oppenheimer postdoc fellow at Los Alamos, added that, “The intriguing concept of combining perovskite nanocrystal in MOF had been demonstrated in powder form, but this is the first time we successfully integrated it as the emission layer in an LED.” - Previous attempts to create nanocrystal LEDs were thwarted by the nanocrystals degrading back to the unwanted bulk phase, losing their nanocrystal advantages and undermining their potential as practical LEDs. Bulk materials consist of billions of atoms. Materials such as perovskites in the nano phase are made of groupings of just a few to a few thousand atoms, and thus behave differently. - In their novel approach, the research team stabilized the nanocrystals by fabricating them within the matrix of a MOF, like tennis balls caught in a chain-link fence. They used lead nodes in the framework as the metal precursor and halide salts as the organic material. The solution of halide salts contains methylammonium bromide, which reacts with lead in the framework to assemble nanocrystals around the lead core trapped in the matrix. The matrix keeps the nanocrystals separated, so they don’t interact and"

This method is based on a solution coating approach, far less expensive than the vacuum processing used to create the inorganic LEDs in wide use today. The MOF-stabilized LEDs can be fabricated to create bright red, blue and green light, along with varying shades of each. - The research team used the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Argonne, to perform time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a technique that allowed them to spot the changes in the perovskite material over time. Researchers were able to track electrical charges as they moved through the material and learned important information about what happens when light is emitted. - In durability tests, the material performed well under ultraviolet radiation, in heat and in an electrical field without degrading and losing its light-detecting and light-emitting efficiency, a key condition for practical applications such as TVs and radiation detectors. • August 23, 2021: Lockheed Martin has invented a new type of satellite dish technology with a wide range of use on satellites and ground terminals, including space-based 5G. The Wide Angle ESA Fed Reflector (WAEFR) antenna is a hybrid of a phased array Electronically Steerable Antenna (ESA) and a parabolic dish and increases coverage area by 190 percent when compared to traditional phased array antennas at a much lower cost. - This antenna is part of a larger research and development investment in 5G.MIL™ technologies that will optimize and securely connect warfighting platforms to enable joint all-domain command and control (JADC2).

WAEFR also features: a) High performance gain of a dish with the beam agility of an ESA b) Low Size Weight and Power (SWAP) common product solution to accommodate any orbital altitude or ground terminal application c) Advances in 3D-printing technology and accelerated parts production. - This type of antenna will also benefit the broader communications and ISR communities by providing a more reliable scanning solution compared to gimbaled designs. - “The primary benefit of the WAEFR approach is accomplishing more mission with fewer resources,” said Thomas Hand, Ph.D., associate technical fellow at Lockheed Martin Space. “While state of the art ESA solutions can address more demanding link performance, capacity, and data rates using multiple agile analog beams, they do so at a premium.” • June 6, 2021: As the digital revolution has now become mainstream, quantum"

Their findings were recently published in the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters. - ""Our report shows how a complex light-shaping method can be used to make two quanta of light interfere with each other in a novel and easily tuneable way"", explains Markus Hiekkamaki. - Single photons (units of light) can have highly complex shapes that are known to be beneficial for quantum technologies such as quantum cryptography, super-sensitive measurements, or quantum-enhanced computational tasks. To make use of these so-called structured photons, it is crucial to make them interfere with other photons. - ""One crucial task in essentially all quantum technological applications is improving the ability to manipulate quantum states in a more complex and reliable way. In photonic quantum technologies, this task involves changing the properties of a single photon as well as interfering multiple photons with each other;"" says Robert Fickler, who leads the Experimental Quantum Optics group at the university.

0,Technologies,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/technologies,EoPortal,EoPortal,Researchers Determine Optimum Pressure to Improve the Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries 10,"Reports. Space telescopes are becoming more and more powerful. Technological developments in recent years have made it possible, for example, to observe objects further and further into the universe or to measure the composition of the Earth's atmosphere with ever greater precision. However, there is still one factor limiting the performance of these telescopes: stray light. A phenomenon that has been known fora long time, stray light results in light reflections (ghost reflections between lenses, scattering, etc.) that damage the quality of images and often lead to blurred images. Until now, the methods for checking and characterizing this stray light during the development phase of the telescopes have been very limited, making it possible to ""just"" know whether or not the instrument was sensitive to the phenomenon, forcing engineers to revise all their calculations in positive cases, leading to considerable delays in the commissioning of these advanced tools. Researchers at the Centre Spatial de Liège (CSL), in collaboration with the University of Strasbourg, have just developed a revolutionary method for solving this problem by using a femto-second pulsed laser to send light beams to illuminate the telescope. ""Stray light rays take (in the telescope) different optical paths from the rays that form the image,"" explains Lionel Clermont, an expert in space optical systems and stray light at CSL. Thanks to this, and using an ultra-fast detector (of the order of 10-9 seconds of resolution, i.e. a thousandth of a millionth of a second), we are measuring the image and the different stray light effects at different"

In addition to this decomposition, we can identify each of the contributors using their arrival times, which are directly related to the optical path, and thus know the origin of the problem."" The CSL engineers have now demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in a paper, just published in the journal Scientific Reports, in which they present the first film showing ghost reflections in a refractive telescope arriving at different times. ""We have also been able to use these measurements to reverse engineer theoretical models,"" says Lionel Clermont, ""which will make it possible, for example, to build better image processing models in the future."" By correlating these measurements with numerical models, the scientists will now be able to determine precisely the origin of the stray light and thus act accordingly to improve the system, both by improving the hardware and with the development of correction algorithms. More than just a scientific curiosity, this method developed at the CSL could well lead to a small revolution in the field of high-performance space instruments. ""We have already received a great deal of interest from the ESA (European Space Agency) and from industrialists in the space sector,"" says Marc Georges, an expert in metrology and lasers at CSL and co-author of the study.

Now an ESA-backed project has come up with yet another use for this ‘wonder stuff’, as the basis for a combined temperature and magnetism sensor. “Any time we can do more with less is a good result for the space sector,” notes ESA materials specialist Ugo Lafont. “Thanks to the unique properties of graphene, our prototype bi-functional sensor can measure magnetic field strength at the same time as taking temperature readings. “And our tests show the sensor operates reliably from room temperature down to 12 degrees Kelvin. Normally separate temperature sensors are required to accurately measure such wide temperature ranges, right down to cryogenic levels.” Graphene’s discoverers won the Nobel Prize in 2010, but its raw material is commonplace enough: graphite, as found in the tip of pencils. Graphene is made out of a single layer of graphite, a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms, so thin that it is transparent, and essentially two-dimensional. Among its other properties, graphene is an excellent electrical conductor, and it is this characteristic that the new bi-functional sensor makes use of. “The intrinsic electrical resistance of graphene changes as a function of temperature, and this allows"

This is where our partner came in, AGP (Advanced Graphene Products) in Poland.” There is a variety of ways to produce graphene, starting with the low-tech method of applying sticky tape to graphite. AGP employs a deposition method, where a graphene layer is built up on a surface, first developed at Poland’s Lodz University of Technology. “Our High Strength Metallurgical Graphene involves forming graphene flakes on the surface of liquid copper, precipitated from a copper-carbon solution,” explains Dominika Kuten. “This differs from the solid surfaces our competitors employ for standard chemical vapor deposition. “This liquid surface is so smooth by comparison to its solid equivalent that the graphene flakes match up to each other, minimizing overlapping and mismatches. We have implemented our technology for mass production, and can produce graphene sheets of up to 1 m in length.” The next step was to align AGP’s graphene sheet to the sensor’s electrical connectors with molecule-scale precision, then safely encapsulate it, a task performed by the PORT (Polish Center for Technology Development). Testing of the prototype sensor took place at AGP as well as Lodz University of"

Developing a sensor that can quickly detect toxic gases or biochemicals is still an important issue in public health, environmental monitoring, and military sectors. Recently, a research team at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science & Technology) of Korea, has developed an inexpensive, ultra-compact wearable hologram sensor that immediately notifies the user of volatile gas detection.

The findings from this study were published in Science Advances on April 7, 2021. For those working in hazardous environments such as petrochemical plants, gas sensors are life. However, conventional gas sensing devices are not widely used due to their high cost of being made with complex machines and electronic devices. In addition, commercial gas sensors have limitations in that they are difficult to use, and have poor portability and reaction speed. To solve these issues, the research team utilized the metasurface, well known as a future optical device known to have the invisible cloak effect through making visible objects disappear by controlling the refractive index of light. Metasurface is especially used to transmit two-way holograms or 3D video images by freely controlling light. Using the metasurface, the research team developed a gas sensor that can float a holographic image alarm in space in just a few seconds by using the polarization control of transmitted light that transforms due to the change in orientation of liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer inside the sensor device when exposed to gas. Moreover, this gas sensor developed by the research team requires no support from external mechanical or electronic devices, unlike other conventional commercial gas sensors. The researchers used isopropyl alcohol as the target hazardous gas, known as a toxic substance that can cause stomach pain, headache, dizziness, and even leukemia. The newly developed sensor"

In an actual experiment using a board marker, a volatile gas source in our daily life, a visual holographic alarm popped up instantaneously the moment the marker was brought to the sensor. Moreover, the research team developed a one-step nanocomposite printing method to produce this flexible and wearable gas sensor. The metasurface structure, which was previously processed on a hard substrate, was designed to enable rapid production with a single-step nanocasting process on a curved or flexible substrate. When the flexible sensor fabricated using this method attaches like a sticker on safety glasses, it can detect gas and display a hologram alarm. It is anticipated to be integrable with glass-type AR display systems under development at Apple, Samsung, Google, and Facebook. Going a step further, the research team is developing a high-performance environmental sensor that can display the type and concentration level of gases or biochemicals in the surroundings with a holographic alarm, and is studying optical design techniques that can encode various holographic images. If these studies are successful, they can be used to reduce accidents caused by biochemical or gas leaks. “This newly developed ultra-compact wearable gas sensor provides a more intuitive holographic visual alarm than the conventional auditory or simple light alarms,” remarked Prof. Junsuk Rho. “It is anticipated to be especially effective in more extreme work environments where acoustic and visual noise are intense.” This study was conducted with the support from the Mid-career Researcher Program, Global Frontier,"

They can thus be used, for example, to measure the gravitational field of the Earth or to detect gravitational waves. A team of scientists from Germany has now managed to successfully perform atom interferometry in space for the first time – on board a sounding rocket. ""We have established the technological basis for atom interferometry on board of a sounding rocket and demonstrated that such experiments are not only possible on Earth, but also in space,"" said Professor Patrick Windpassinger of the Institute of Physics at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), whose team was involved in the investigation. The results of their analyses have been published in Nature Communications. A team of researchers from various universities and research centers led by Leibniz University Hannover launched the MAIUS-1 (Matter-Wave Interferometry in Microgravity-1) mission in January 2017. This has since become the first rocket mission on which a Bose-Einstein condensate has been generated in space. This special state of matter occurs when atoms – in this case atoms of rubidium – are cooled to a temperature close to absolute zero, or minus 273 degrees Celsius. ""For us, this ultracold ensemble represented a very promising starting point for atom interferometry,"" explained Windpassinger. Temperature is one of the determining factors, because measurements"
0,Technologies,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/technologies,EoPortal,EoPortal,Researchers Determine Optimum Pressure to Improve the Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries 18,"can be carried out more accurately and for longer periods at lower temperatures. Atom interferometry: Generating atomic interference by spatial separation and subsequent superposition of atoms During the experiments, the gas of rubidium atoms was separated using laser light irradiation and then subsequently superpositioned. Depending on the forces acting on the atoms on their different paths, several interference patterns can be produced, which in turn can be used to measure the forces that are influencing them, such as gravity. Laying the groundwork for precision measurements The study first demonstrated the coherence, or interference capability, of the Bose-Einstein condensate as a fundamentally required property of the atomic ensemble. To this end, the atoms in the interferometer were only partially superimposed by means of varying the light sequence, which, in the case of coherence, led to the generation of a spatial intensity modulation. The research team has thus demonstrated the viability of the concept, which may lead to further experiments targeting the measurement of the Earth's gravitational field, the detection of gravitational waves, and a test of Einstein's equivalence principle. Even more measurements will be possible when MAIUS-2 and MAIUS-3 are launched In the near future, the team wants to go further and investigate the feasibility of high-precision atom interferometry to test Einstein's principle of equivalence. Two more rocket launches, MAIUS-2 and MAIUS-3, are planned for 2022 and 2023, and on these missions the team also intends to use potassium atoms, in addition to rubidium atoms, to produce interference patterns.

""Undertaking this kind of experiment would be a future objective on satellites or the International Space Station ISS, possibly within BECCAL, the Bose Einstein Condensate and Cold Atom Laboratory, which is currently in the planning phase. In this case, the achievable accuracy would not be constrained by the limited free-fall time aboard a rocket,"" explained Dr. André Wenzlawski, a member of Windpassinger's research group at JGU, who is directly involved in the launch missions. The experiment is one example of the highly active research field of quantum technologies, which also includes developments in the fields of quantum communication, quantum sensors, and quantum computing. The MAIUS-1 sounding rocket mission was implemented as a joint project involving Leibniz University Hannover, the University of Bremen, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Universität Hamburg, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut in Berlin, and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Financing for the project was arranged by the Space Administration of the German Aerospace Center and funds were provided by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy on the basis of a resolution of the German Bundestag. • March 22, 2021: Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, have produced a structural battery that performs ten times better than all previous versions.

A structural battery, on the other hand, is one that works as both a power source and as part of the structure – for example, in a car body. This is termed ‘massless’ energy storage, because in essence the battery’s weight vanishes when it becomes part of the load-bearing structure. Calculations show that this type of multifunctional battery could greatly reduce the mass of an electric vehicle. The development of structural batteries at Chalmers University of Technology has proceeded through many years of research, including previous discoveries involving certain types of carbon fibre. In addition to being stiff and strong, they also have a good ability to store electrical energy chemically. This work was named by Physics World as one of 2018’s ten biggest scientific breakthroughs. The first attempt to make a structural battery was made as early as 2007, but it has so far proven difficult to manufacture batteries with both good electrical and mechanical properties. But now the development has taken a real step forward, with researchers from Chalmers, in collaboration with KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, presenting a structural battery with properties that far exceed anything yet seen, in terms of electrical energy storage, stiffness and strength. Its multifunctional performance is ten times higher than previous structural battery prototypes. The battery has an energy density of 24 Wh/kg, meaning approximately 20 percent capacity compared to comparable lithium-ion batteries currently available. But since"

And with a stiffness of 25 GPa, the structural battery can really compete with many other commonly used construction materials. “Previous attempts to make structural batteries have resulted in cells with either good mechanical properties, or good electrical properties. But here, using carbon fibre, we have succeeded in designing a structural battery with both competitive energy storage capacity and rigidity,” explains Leif Asp, Professor at Chalmers and leader of the project. Super light electric bikes and consumer electronics could soon be a reality The new battery has a negative electrode made of carbon fibre, and a positive electrode made of a lithium iron phosphate-coated aluminum foil. They are separated by a fibreglass fabric, in an electrolyte matrix. Despite their success in creating a structural battery ten times better than all previous ones, the researchers did not choose the materials to try and break records – rather, they wanted to investigate and understand the effects of material architecture and separator thickness. Now, a new project, financed by the Swedish National Space Agency, is underway, where the performance of the structural battery will be increased yet further.

The new project is expected to be completed within two years. Leif Asp, who is leading this project too, estimates that such a battery could reach an energy density of 75 Wh/kg and a stiffness of 75 GPa. This would make the battery about as strong as aluminum, but with a comparatively much lower weight. “The next generation structural battery has fantastic potential. If you look at consumer technology, it could be quite possible within a few years to manufacture smartphones, laptops or electric bicycles that weigh half as much as today and are much more compact”, says Leif Asp. And in the longer term, it is absolutely conceivable that electric cars, electric planes and satellites will be designed with and powered by structural batteries. “We are really only limited by our imaginations here. We have received a lot of attention from many different types of companies in connection with the publication of our scientific articles in the field. There is understandably a great amount of interest in these lightweight, multifunctional materials,” says Leif Asp. More about: The research on structural batteries The structural battery uses carbon fibre as a negative electrode, and a lithium iron phosphate-coated aluminum foil as the positive electrode. The carbon fibre acts as a host for the lithium and thus stores the energy. Since the carbon fibre also conducts electrons, the need for copper and silver conductors is also avoided – reducing the weight even further. Both the carbon fibre and the aluminum foil"

The two electrode materials are kept separated by a fibreglass fabric in a structural electrolyte matrix. The task of the electrolyte is to transport the lithium ions between the two electrodes of the battery, but also to transfer mechanical loads between carbon fibres and other parts. The project is run in collaboration between Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden's two largest technical universities. The battery electrolyte has been developed at KTH. The project involves researchers from five different disciplines: material mechanics, materials engineering, lightweight structures, applied electrochemistry and fibre and polymer technology.

Ordinarily producing precision parts in such high-performance materials would be costly in both time and money, but the company can instead shape them using standard 3D printing techniques. TIWARI’s ‘Fused Filament Fabrication’ (FFF) print process uses thermoplastic filaments that are embedded with particles of the metal or ceramic the part is to be made from. Once the printing is finished, the part – known as a ‘green body’ – is put through a thermal treatment to eliminate the plastic, leaving behind a metal or ceramic item. “Once this plastic-containing body goes through this treatment then what is left behind is pure metal or ceramic,”"

So this cheap, simple technique can offer us additional part manufacturing capability for space applications with an expanded pallet of materials.” Test parts made using the FFF process in stainless steel and titanium metals, as well as aluminia and silicon carbide ceramics underwent a full-scale campaign of non-destructive and destructive testing at the Materials and Electrical Components Laboratory of ESA’s ESTEC technical centre in the Netherlands, assessing their added value and suitability for space. One surprise has been that the parts possess enhanced mechanical performance compared to their conventionally made equivalents – for instance, stainless steel can be elongated to a previously unachievable 100% without breaking. TIWARI is a startup hosted at ESA’s Business Incubation Centre Hessen & Baden-Württemberg in Germany, specializing in instruments for thermal characterization of materials as well as 3D printing of high-performance metals and ceramics. “Desktop 3D printers have become cheaper and cheaper in recent years and there’s been a lot of interest in mixing in materials with traditional print stock,” explains company founder Siddharth Tiwari. “But our company’s particular focus has really been on understanding the process thoroughly and investigating the kind of thermal and mechanical properties we can achieve. “So this test campaign with ESA was part of our strategic planning from the start, to help commercialize the technology.

Being able to actively correct a telescope mirror’s shape offers a way forward. Piezoelectric actuators placed under this prototype 50 mm mirror serve to deform its shape.

A novel concept for laser-beam based communications, using an almost noiseless optical preamplifier in the receiver, was recently demonstrated by researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. In a new paper published in the scientific journal Nature: Light Science & Applications, a team of researchers describes a free-space optical transmission system relying on an optical amplifier that, in principle, does not add any excess noise – in contrast to all other preexisting optical amplifiers, referred to as phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSAs). The researchers’ new concept demonstrates an unprecedented receiver sensitivity of just one photon-per-information bit at a data rate of 10 gigabits per second. “Our results show the viability of this new approach for extending the reach and data rate in long-distance space communication links. It therefore also has the promise to help break through the present-day data-return bottleneck in deep-space missions, that space agencies around the world are suffering from today,” says Professor Peter Andrekson, head of the research group and author of the article together with PhD Ravikiran Kakarla and senior researcher Jochen Schröder at the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience – MC2, at Chalmers University of Technology. Substantially increasing the reach and information rate"

Systems for such high-speed data connections are increasingly using optical laser beams rather than radio-frequency beams. A key reason for this is that the loss of power as the beam propagates is substantially smaller at light wavelengths, since the beam divergence is reduced. Nevertheless, over long distances, light beams also experience large loss. For example, a laser beam sent from the Earth to the Moon – around 400,000 km – with a 10 cm aperture size, will experience a loss of power of around 80 dB, meaning only 1 part in 100 million will remain. As the transmittable power is limited, it is of critical importance to have receivers that can recover the information sent with as low power received as possible. This sensitivity is quantified as the minimum number of photons per information bit necessary to recover the data without error. The new concept from Chalmers In the new concept from Chalmers, information is encoded onto a signal wave, which along with a pump wave at different frequency generates a conjugated wave (known as an idler) in a nonlinear medium. These three waves are launched together into the free space. At the receiving point, after capturing the light in an optical fiber, the PSA amplifies the signal using a regenerated pump wave. The amplified signal is then detected in a conventional receiver. “This approach fundamentally results in the best possible"

The system uses a simple modulation format encoded with a standard error correction code and a coherent receiver with digital signal processing for signal recovery. This method is straightforwardly scalable to much higher data rates if needed. It also operates at room temperature, meaning it can be implemented in space terminals and not only on the ground. The theoretical sensitivity limits of this approach are also discussed in the paper and compared to other existing methods, with the conclusion that the new approach is essentially the best possible for a very broad range of data rates.

Their basic paraboloid convex shape is distorted with additional peaks and valleys. These serve to contour the resulting radio frequency beam, typically to boost signal gain over target countries and minimize it beyond their borders. “This is really a first for Europe,” says ESA antenna engineer Jean-Christophe Angevain. “China and the US have also been working hard on similar shaped mesh reflector technology. It is needed so that sufficiently large antennas can be deployed in orbit, which would otherwise be too bulky to fit inside a launcher fairing, while also meeting required performance levels.” ESA’s AMPER (Advanced techniques for mesh reflector with improved radiation pattern performance) project"

The obvious solution would have been a conventional tension truss double layer solution, with the mesh held together tautly on an alternating ‘push and ‘pull’ basis. A smart alternative solution has been proposed and followed by the team.” Leri Datashvili, CEO and Chief Designer of Large Space Structures explains: “The design of our shaped mesh reflector is based on tension members supported by a peripheral truss structure which enables decoupling of the shaped surface and the structure. Therefore, the design can be implemented for any size of reflector, for any frequencies ranging from P-band to Ka-band. Furthermore, either deployable or fixed reflector technology can be realized.” “This 2.6-m ‘breadboard’ prototype proves the concept at C-band frequency, and the RF measurements have shown good correlation with radio-frequency and mechanical predictions” adds Jean-Christophe. The AMPER project was supported through ESA’s Technology Development Element, with prototype testing carried out in ESA’s Hertz chamber at its ESTEC technical centre in the Netherlands. As a next step the AMPER team plan to produce a deployable version, aimed at Earth observation as well as telecommunications uses. Meanwhile this prototype reflector will be on show during next month’s virtual ESA Open Day at ESTEC. • If we can harness it, quantum technology promises"

But first, scientists need to coax quantum systems to stay yoked for longer than a few millionths of a second. A team of scientists at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering announced the discovery of a simple modification that allows quantum systems to stay operational — or ""coherent"" — 10,000 times longer than before. Though the scientists tested their technique on a particular class of quantum systems called solid-state qubits, they think it should be applicable to many other kinds of quantum systems and could thus revolutionize quantum communication, computing and sensing. The study was published Aug. 13 in Science. ""This breakthrough lays the groundwork for exciting new avenues of research in quantum science,"" said study lead author David Awschalom, the Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering, senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and director of the Chicago Quantum Exchange. ""The broad applicability of this discovery, coupled with a remarkably simple implementation, allows this robust coherence to impact many aspects of quantum engineering. It enables new research opportunities previously thought impractical."" Down at the level of atoms, the world operates according to the rules of quantum mechanics — very different from what we see around us in our daily lives. These different rules could translate into technology like virtually unhackable networks or extremely powerful computers; the U.S. Department of Energy released a blueprint for the future quantum internet in an event at UChicago on July 23.

Thus, scientists try to find ways to keep the system coherent as long as possible. One common approach is physically isolating the system from the noisy surroundings, but this can be unwieldy and complex. Another technique involves making all of the materials as pure as possible, which can be costly. The scientists at UChicago took a different tack. ""With this approach, we don't try to eliminate noise in the surroundings; instead, we ""trick"" the system into thinking it doesn't experience the noise,"" said postdoctoral researcher Kevin Miao, the first author of the paper. In tandem with the usual electromagnetic pulses used to control quantum systems, the team applied an additional continuous alternating magnetic field. By precisely tuning this field, the scientists could rapidly rotate the electron spins and allow the system to ""tune out"" the rest of the noise. ""To get a sense of the principle, it's like sitting on a merry-go-round with people yelling all around you,"" Miao explained. ""When the ride is still, you can hear them perfectly, but if you're rapidly spinning, the noise blurs into a background."" This small change allowed the system to stay coherent up to 22 milliseconds, four orders of magnitude higher than without the modification — and far longer than any previously reported electron spin system. (For comparison, a blink of an eye takes about 350 milliseconds). The system is able to almost completely tune out some forms of temperature"

The simple fix could unlock discoveries in virtually every area of quantum technology, the scientists said. ""This approach creates a pathway to scalability,"" said Awschalom. ""It should make storing quantum information in electron spin practical. Extended storage times will enable more complex operations in quantum computers and allow quantum information transmitted from spin-based devices to travel longer distances in networks."" Though their tests were run in a solid-state quantum system using silicon carbide, the scientists believe the technique should have similar effects in other types of quantum systems, such as superconducting quantum bits and molecular quantum systems. This level of versatility is unusual for such an engineering breakthrough. ""There are a lot of candidates for quantum technology that were pushed aside because they couldn't maintain quantum coherence for long periods of time,"" Miao said. ""Those could be re-evaluated now that we have this way to massively improve coherence. ""The best part is, it's incredibly easy to do,"" he added. ""The science behind it is intricate, but the logistics of adding an alternating magnetic field are very straightforward."" • June 17, 2020: Information technology continues to progress at a rapid pace. However, the growing demands of data centers have pushed electrical input-output systems to their physical limit, which has created a bottleneck. Maintaining this growth will require a shift in how we built computers. The future is optical. Over the last decade, the field of photonics has provided a solution to the chip-to-chip bandwidth"

One element of this revolution, silicon photonics, was advanced fifteen years ago when UC Santa Barbara and Intel demonstrated silicon laser technology. This has since triggered an explosion of this field. Intel is now delivering millions of silicon photonic transceivers for data centers all around the world. Now, a collaboration between UC Santa Barbara, Caltech, and EPFL have made another revolutionary discovery in the field. The group managed to simplify and condense a complex optical system onto a single silicon photonic chip. The achievement, published in Nature, significantly lowers the cost of production and allows for easy integration with traditional, silicon chip production. “The entire internet is driven by photonics now,” says John Bowers, who holds the Fred Kavli Chair in Nanotechnology at UC Santa Barbara and directs the campus’s Institute for Energy Efficiency and led the collaborative research effort. Despite the great success of photonics in the internet’s backbone, there are still challenges. The explosion of data traffic also means growing requirements for the data rates that silicon photonic chip can handle. So far, most efficient way to address this demand is to use multicolor laser lights to transmit information: the more laser colors, the more information can be carried. But this poses a problem for integrated lasers, which can generate only one color of laser light at a time. “You might literally need fifty or more lasers in that"
0,Technologies,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/technologies,EoPortal,EoPortal,Researchers Determine Optimum Pressure to Improve the Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries 34,"chip for that purpose,” says Bowers. And using fifty lasers is expensive and inefficient in terms of power. Also, noise and heat can cause the frequency of light that each laser produces to fluctuate. Finally, with multiple lasers, the frequencies can even drift into each other, much like early radio stations did. A solution can be found in the technology of “optical frequency combs”, which are collections of equally spaced frequencies of laser light. Plotting the frequencies reveals spikes and dips that resemble a hair comb — hence the name. Generating combs used to require bulky and expensive equipment, but this can be now managed using the recently emerged microresonator-based soliton frequency combs, which are miniaturized frequency comb sources built on CMOS photonic chips. Using this “integrated photonics” approach, the collaborating team has developed the smallest comb generator in the world, which essentially resolves all of these issues. The system is rather simple, consisting of a commercially available feedback laser and a silicon nitride photonic chip. “What we have is a source that generates all these colors out of one laser and one chip,” says Bowers. “That’s what’s significant about this.” The simple structure means small scale, less power, and lower cost. The entire setup now fits in a package smaller than a match box whose overall price and power consumption are smaller than previous systems. The new technology is also much more convenient to operate. Previously, generating a stable comb had been a tricky endeavor. Researchers would have to adjust frequency and power just right"

Kippenberg, Professor of Physics at EPFL who leads the Laboratory and Photonics and Quantum Measurement (LPQM), and whose laboratory first observed microcombs more than a decade ago. The EPFL team has provided the ultralow-loss silicon nitride photonic chips, which were fabricated in at EPFL Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi) and serve as the key component for soliton comb generation. The low-loss silicon nitride photonics technology has been commercialized via the lab startup LIGENTEC. The “magic” behind all these improvements lies in an interesting physical phenomenon: when the pump laser and resonator are integrated, their interaction forms a highly coupled system that is self-injection-locking and simultaneously generates “solitons” – pulses that circulate indefinitely inside the resonator and give rise to optical frequency combs. The new technology is expected to have an extensive impact on photonics. In addition to addressing the demands of multicolor light sources in communication-related products, it also opens up a lot of new opportunities in many applications. One example is optical clocks, which provide the most accurate time standard in the world and are"

With integrated photonics, we can make something that could fit in a wristwatch, and you could afford it.” “Low-noise integrated optical microcombs will enable a new generation of optical clocks, communications and sensors,” says Gordon Keeler, the project’s manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). “We should see more compact, more sensitive GPS receivers coming out of this approach.” All in all, the future looks bright for photonics. “It is the key step to transfer the frequency comb technology from the laboratory to the real world,” says Bowers. “It will change photonics and our daily lives.” This research was a collaboration of UC Santa Barbara, the California Institute of Technology and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). The project was funded by DARPA’s Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesizer (DODOS) program, which demonstrated optical synthesizers using photonic integrated circuits. • May 22, 2020: Dr Amruta Gadge from the Quantum Systems and Devices Laboratory successfully created a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) - considered to be the fifth state of matter - using quantum technology based at the University of Sussex lab facilities (UK) despite working remotely from her living room two miles away.

We are all extremely excited that we can continue to conduct our experiments remotely during lockdown, and any possible future lockdowns. ""But there are also wider implications beyond our team. Enhancing the capabilities of remote lab control is relevant for research applications aimed at operating quantum technology in inaccessible environments such as space, underground, in a submarine, or in extreme climates.” A BEC consists of a cloud of hundreds of thousands of rubidium atoms cooled down to nanokelvin temperatures which is more than a billion times colder than freezing. At this point the atoms take on a different property and behave all together as a single quantum object. This quantum object has special properties which can sense very low magnetic fields.

This requires accurate computer control of laser light, magnets and electric currents in microchips based on vigilant monitoring of environmental conditions in the lab while nobody is able to be there to check in person.” The Quantum Systems and Devices Group have been working on having a second lab with a BEC running consistently over the past nine months as part of a wider project developing a new type of magnetic microscopy and other quantum sensors.

The scientists have seen unexpected things in supercurrents – electricity that moves through materials without resistance, usually at super cold temperatures – that break symmetry and are supposed to be forbidden by the conventional laws of physics, said Jigang Wang, a professor of physics and astronomy at Iowa State University, a senior scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory and the leader of the project. Wang’s lab has pioneered use of light pulses at terahertz frequencies– trillions of pulses per second – to accelerate electron pairs, known as Cooper pairs, within supercurrents. In this case, the researchers tracked light emitted by the accelerated electrons pairs. What they found were “second harmonic light emissions,” or light at twice the frequency of the incoming light used to accelerate electrons. That, Wang said,"
0,Technologies,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/technologies,EoPortal,EoPortal,Researchers Determine Optimum Pressure to Improve the Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries 40,"is analogous to color shifting from the red spectrum to the deep blue. “These second harmonic terahertz emissions are supposed to be forbidden in superconductors,” he said. “This is against the conventional wisdom.” Wang and his collaborators – including Ilias Perakis, professor and chair of physics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Chang-beom Eom, the Raymond R. Holton Chair for Engineering and Theodore H. Geballe Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison – report their discovery in a research paper just published online by the scientific journal Physical Review Letters. “The forbidden light gives us access to an exotic class of quantum phenomena – that’s the energy and particles at the small scale of atoms – called forbidden Anderson pseudo-spin precessions,” Perakis said. (The phenomena are named after the late Philip W. Anderson, co-winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics who conducted theoretical studies of electron movements within disordered materials such as glass that lack a regular structure.) Wang’s recent studies have been made possible by a tool called quantum terahertz spectroscopy that can visualize and steer electrons. It uses terahertz laser flashes as a control knob to accelerate supercurrents and access new and potentially useful quantum states of matter. The National Science Foundation has supported development of the instrument as well as the current study of forbidden light. The scientists say access to this and other quantum phenomena could help drive major innovations: - “Just like today’s gigahertz transistors and 5G wireless routers replaced megahertz vacuum tubes or thermionic valves over half a"

The National Science Foundation has included quantum studies in its ‘10 Big Ideas’ for future research and development critical to our nation.” - Wang said, “The determination and understanding of symmetry breaking in superconducting states is a new frontier in both fundamental quantum matter discovery and practical quantum information science. Second harmonic generation is a fundamental symmetry probe. This will be useful in the development of future quantum computing strategies and electronics with high speeds and low energy consumption.” Before they can get there, though, researchers need to do more exploring of the quantum world. And this forbidden second harmonic light emission in superconductors, Wang said, represents “a fundamental discovery of quantum matter.” • May 19, 2020: A tiny sail made of the thinnest material known – one carbon-atom-thick graphene – has passed initial tests designed to show that it could be a viable material to make solar sails for spacecraft.

The reason: The molecules absorb the energy supplied to them and gradually emit it again in the form of light. This process is called electroluminescence. Light-emitting diodes are based on this principle. This green luminescent substance is a hot candidate for producing OLEDs. For about three years now, OLEDs have been found in the displays of smartphones, for example. In the meantime, the first flexible television screens with these materials have also come onto the market. In addition, OLEDs make cost-efficient room lighting with a large surface area possible. First, however, the materials best suited to this application need to be found. That's because many substances under consideration for OLEDs contain expensive materials such as iridium, and this impedes"

Without such additives, the materials can actually emit only a small part of the energy supplied to them as light; the rest is lost, for example as vibrational energy. The goal of current research is to find more efficient materials for cheaper and more environmentally friendly displays and large-area lighting. Here, inexpensive and readily available metals such as copper promise progress. Under close examination Researchers have now made a more precise examination of the copper-containing compound CuPCP. There are four copper atoms in the middle of each molecule, surrounded by carbon and phosphorus atoms. Copper is a relatively inexpensive metal, and the compound itself can be easily produced in large quantities - ideal preconditions for use over large extensive surfaces. ""We wanted to understand what the excited state of the compound looks like,"" says Grigory Smolentsev, a physicist in the operando spectroscopy research group. That is: How does the substance change when it absorbs energy? For example, does the structure of the molecule change? How is the charge distributed over the individual atoms after excitation? ""This reveals how high the losses of energy that will not be released as light are likely to be,"" added Smolentsev, ""and it shows us how we can possibly minimize these losses.""

The measurements confirmed that the substance is a good candidate for OLEDs due to its chemical structure. The compound's quantum chemical properties make it possible to achieve a high light yield. One reason for this is that the molecule is relatively stiff, and its 3D structure changes only slightly when excited. Now researchers can start to further optimize this substance for use in OLEDs. Tools for the future What's more, the measurements at the three large research facilities at PSI and in Grenoble were significant not only for the investigation of this one copper-containing compound. There was more at stake: The experimental data obtained this way are also helpful in improving theoretical calculations regarding molecules in general. ""So in the future it will be possible to better predict which compounds are more suitable for OLEDs and which less,"" says Grigory Smolentsev.

Once manufactured, the chips, still on the wafer, are tested. The wafers are then chopped up. They become ready for use when placed inside protective packages – just like standard terrestrial microprocessors – and undergo final quality tests. Through little metal pins or balls sticking out of their packages these miniature brains are then connected to other circuit elements – such as sensors, actuators, memory or power systems – used across the satellite. Considering the time and money needed to develop complex chips like these, ESA’s Microelectronics section maintains a catalogue of chip designs, known as Intellectual Property (IP) cores, available to European industry through ESA licence. • March 11, 202: ESA has backed the creation of this flexible, ultra-thin solar cell to deliver the best power to mass ratio for space missions. Possessing up to 32% ‘end of life’ efficiency, the solar cells were produced using a technique called ‘epitaxial lift-off’, meaning they were peeled off the Germanium substrate layer they were initially laid down on, so the costly material can be reused. Both triple- and quadruple-junction solar cells were manufactured. This means they consist of three or four different layers of material, optimized to make use of different wavelengths of light making up the solar spectrum. These thinner-than-paper solar cells could be harnessed for future ESA satellites or else high-altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS) – uncrewed aircraft or balloons to perform satellite-like tasks from the upper atmosphere. • February 27, 2020: Dutch shipbuilder Royal Huisman applied the same concurrent engineering process developed by ESA"

Sea Eagle II’s modern style extends to its design, which took place using concurrent engineering, taking inspiration from the long-established Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) at ESA’s technical center ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, where it is employed for performing preliminary design and assessment of potential future space missions and systems. “Satellites and superyachts are both complex machines, and concurrent engineering is advantageous in designing any complex system,” explains Massimo Bandecchi, founder of ESA’s CDF. “The basic idea is simple: bring together all necessary experts and design tools into a single room to work together as a team on a shared software model that updates immediately as changes are made, to assess design feasibility and trade-offs in a much more effective and reliable way.” “While our main focus is fulfilling the needs of ESA engineering, there has also been strong interest in our work from industry. Concurrent engineering’s improved performance in terms of time, cost and efficiency speaks for itself. The result is that more than 50 centers have been built following ESA’s original CDF model and are now in operation across Europe, the majority in the space sector, plus around 10 non-space centers.” Stefan Coronel, Royal Huisman’s Design and Engineering Manager, received training from Massimo and his team before setting up his own concurrent engineering room: “Yacht building is not rocket science, but it does involve a complex, multi-disciplinary"

In the modern yard-building world there isn’t so much time to spare. “That said, compared to the dramatic shortening of satellite conceptual design time achieved by ESA, the main benefit we see from concurrent engineering is not gaining time but that the quality of the final design ends up much better, and more complete – giving us confidence to proceed to the build phase.” Royal Huisman is now applying concurrent engineering to all of their new builds, and many of their refitting and service projects. Mr. Coronel adds: “Our room is not as fancy as ESA’s CDF, but has the same basic approach of a place where everyone can contribute, with means of accessing all normal engineering tools and calculation methods, plus a splinter room for small separate discussions.” In the same way that satellite design is broken down into subsystems, yacht design involves some main disciplines taking part in all the sessions: structural strength and stiffness; deck and sail handling; systems such as propulsion, power, heating and air conditioning; electronics and finally interior design – creating a desirable, luxurious interior. Additional external experts, such as noise and vibration specialists, attend as required. “The kind of trade-offs that concurrent engineering makes easier to resolve include"

While any staircase needs to be open and attractive, while also having pipes and electrical cables run through it, and meeting all relevant fire and safety regulations.” The company’s adoption of concurrent engineering also meant Sea Eagle II’s aluminum panels have had holes and support structures added to them in advance, saving time in construction and the integration of feature such as winches or hatches.

When light is shone through these materials, the refractive index in the path of the beam increases, generating its own, light-made waveguide. Currently, most non-linear materials require high-powered lasers or are permanently changed by the transmission of light. Here, researchers developed a fundamentally new material that uses reversible swelling and contracting in a hydrogel under low laser power to change the refractive index. The hydrogel is composed of a polymer network that is swollen with water, like a sponge, and a small number of light-responsive molecules known as spiropyran (which is similar to the molecule used to tint transition lenses). When light is shone through the gel, the area under the light contracts a small amount, concentrating the polymer and changing the refractive index. When the light is turned off, the gel returns to its original state. When multiple beams are shone through the material, they interact and affect each other, even at large distances. Beam A could inhibit Beam B, Beam B could inhibit Beam A, both could cancel each other out or both could go through — creating an optical logic gate. “Though they are separated, the beams still see each other and change as a result,” said Kalaichelvi Saravanamuttu, an associate professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at McMaster and co-senior author of the study. “We can imagine, in the long term, designing computing operations using this intelligent responsiveness.” ""Not only can we design photoresponsive materials that reversibly switch their optical, chemical and physical"

Our reversibly responsive material that controls light at exceptionally small intensities is yet another demonstration of this promising technological revolution.” • January 21, 2020: Quicker is not always better, especially when it comes to a 3D sensor in advanced technology. With applications in autonomous vehicles, robots and drones, security systems and more, researchers are striving for a 3D sensor that is compact and easy to use. A team from Yokohama National University in Japan believes they have developed a method to obtain such a sensor by taking advantage of slow light, an unexpected move in a field where speed is often valued above other variables. They published their results on 14 January 20 in the Optica, a journal published by The Optical Society. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors can map the distance between distant objects and more using laser light. In modern LiDAR sensors, many of the systems are composed of a laser source; a photodetector, which converts light into current; and an optical beam steering device, which directs the light into the proper location.

""This makes the device large and heavy, with limited overall speed and a high cost. It all becomes unstable, particularly in mobile devices, hampering the wide range of applications."" In recent years, according to Baba, more engineers have turned toward optical phased arrays, which direct the optical beam without mechanical parts. But, Baba warned, such an approach can become complicated due to the sheer number of optical antennae required, as well as the time and precision needed to calibrate each piece. ""In our study, we employed another approach - what we call 'slow light,'"" Baba said. Baba and his team used a special waveguide ""photonic crystal,"" aimed through a silicon-etched medium. Light is slowed down and emitted to the free space when forced to interact with the photonic crystal. The researchers engaged a prism lens to then direct the beam in the desired direction. ""The non-mechanical steering is thought to be crucial for LiDAR sensors,"" Baba said. The resulting method and device are small-sized, free of moving mechanics, setting the stage for a solid-state LiDAR. Such a device is considered smaller, cheaper to make and more resilient, especially in mobile applications such as autonomous vehicles. Next, Baba and his team plan to more fully demonstrate the potential of a solid-state LiDAR, as well as work on improving its performance with the ultimate goal"

The pilot service, using plants as the energy source, has been developed by the Dutch company Plant-e and Lacuna Space,which is based in the Netherlands and the UK, under ESA’s ARTES (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) program. Because the sensor doesn’t need batteries, due to the internal storage in the system, it’ll reduce cost, maintenance requirements and environmental impact. As long as plants continue to grow, electricity will be produced. Such sensors could be used to connect everyday objects in remote locations, enabling them to send and receive data as part of the IoT (Internet of Things). The device can inform farmers about the conditions of their crops to help increase yield, and enable retailers to gain detailed information about potential harvests. It transmits data on air humidity, soil moisture and temperature, enabling field-by-field reporting from agricultural land, rice fields or other aquatic environments. The extremely low power device sends signals at radio frequencies that are picked up by satellites in LEO (Low Earth Orbit). Plants produce organic matter through photosynthesis, but only part of this matter is used for plant growth. The rest is excreted into the soil through the plant’s roots. In the soil, bacteria around the roots break down this organic matter, releasing electrons as a waste product.

It’s also very adhesive, and it doesn’t fall off, so there are so many avenues for this material,” Professor Xinyu Liu (MIE), whose lab is focused on the emerging areas of ionic skin and soft robotics. - The adhesive AISkin is made of two oppositely charged sheets of stretchable substances known as hydrogels. By overlaying negative and positive ions, the researchers create what they call a “sensing junction” on the gel’s surface. - When the AISkin is subjected to strain, humidity or changes in temperature, it generates controlled ion movements across the sensing junction, which can be measured as electrical signals such as voltage or current. - “If you look at human skin, how we sense heat or pressure, our neural cells transmit information through ions — it’s really not so different from our artificial skin,” says Liu. - AISkin is also uniquely tough and stretchable. “Our human skin can stretch about 50 per cent, but our AISkin can stretch up to 400 per cent of its length without breaking,” says Binbin Ying (MIE), a"

An example is soft robotic grippers used in factories to handle delicate objects such as light bulbs or food. - The researchers envision AISkin being integrated onto soft robots to measure data, whether it’s the temperature of food or the pressure necessary to handle brittle objects. - Over the next year, Liu’s lab will be focused on further enhancing their AISkin, aiming to shrink the size of AISkin sensors through microfabrication. They’ll also add bio-sensing capabilities to the material, allowing it to measure biomolecules in body fluids such as sweat. - “If we further advance this research, this could be something we put on like a ‘smart bandage,’” says Liu. “Wound healing requires breathability, moisture balance – ionic skin feels like the natural next"

In the same way that optical lenses focus light, waveguide lenses serve to direct electromagnetic radio wave energy in a given direction – for instance to send out a radar or a communication signal – and minimize energy loss in the process. Traditional waveguide lenses have complex electrically-sensitive ‘dielectric’ material to restrict electromagnetic signals as desired, but this water drop waveguide lens – once its top plate has been added on – comes down purely to its curved shape directing signals through it. The lack of dielectrics in this shape-based design is an advantage, especially for space – where they would risk giving off unwanted fumes in orbital vacuum.

Now, for the first time, scientists have created a silicon chip that can accelerate electrons — albeit at a fraction of the velocity of the most massive accelerators — using an infrared laser to deliver, in less than a hair's width, the sort of energy boost that takes microwaves many feet. Writing in the Jan. 3 issue of Science, a team led by electrical engineer Jelena Vuckovic explained how they carved a nanoscale channel out of silicon, sealed it in a vacuum and sent electrons through this cavity while pulses of infrared light—to which silicon is as transparent as glass is to visible light—were transmitted by the channel walls to speed the electrons along.

Accelerator-on-a-chip technology could also lead to new cancer radiation therapies, said physicist Robert Byer, a co-author of the Science paper. Again, it’s a matter of size. Today, medical X-ray machines fill a room and deliver a beam of radiation that’s tough to focus on tumors, requiring patients to wear lead shields to minimize collateral damage. “In this paper we begin to show how it might be possible to deliver electron beam radiation directly to a tumor, leaving healthy tissue unaffected,” said Byer, who leads the ACHIP (Accelerator on a Chip International Program), a broader effort of which this current research is a part.

The researchers want to accelerate electrons to 94 percent of the speed of light, or 1 million electron volts (1MeV), to create a particle flow powerful enough for research or medical purposes. This prototype chip provides only a single stage of acceleration, and the electron flow would have to pass through around 1,000 of these stages to achieve 1MeV. But that's not as daunting at it may seem, said Vuckovic, because this prototype accelerator-on-a-chip is a fully integrated circuit. That means all of the critical functions needed to create acceleration are built right into the chip, and increasing its capabilities should be reasonably straightforward. The researchers plan to pack a thousand stages of acceleration into roughly an inch of chip space by the end of 2020 to reach their 1MeV target. Although that would be an important milestone, such a device would still pale in power alongside the capabilities of the SLAC research accelerator, which can generate energy levels 30,000 times greater than 1MeV.

Connected cars need to switch seamlessly between terrestrial and satellite networks, so that people and goods can move across the country without any glitches. Darwin relies on a terminal that will allow seamless switching between the networks. Daniela Petrovic of Telefonica O2, who founded Darwin, said: “There is a really nice ecosystem of players delivering innovation. ESA provided the opportunities to start discussions with satellite operators and helped us create this partnership. “There is a good body of knowledge within ESA on innovation and science hubs and this gave us the opportunity to see what other start-ups are doing. Through ESA, we are getting exposure to 22 member state countries which can see the opportunity and maybe get involved.” Magali Vaissiere, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said: “We are very excited to see the response of industry to our Space for 5G initiative, which aims to bring together the cellular and satellite telecommunications world and provide the connectivity fabric to enable the digital transformation of industry and society. “The showcase of flagship 5G projects today confirms the strategic importance of our Space for 5G initiative, which will be a significant strategic part of the"

Such ‘luminescence’ testing is performed routinely in ESA’s Solar Generator Laboratory, employed to detect cell defects – such as the cracks highlighted here. By happy accident the solar (or ‘photovoltaic’) cell was invented in 1954, just before the start of the Space Age, allowing satellites to run off the abundant sunshine found in Earth orbit and beyond. Solar cells, carefully assembled together into arrays, are an essential part of space missions, together with specially-designed batteries for times when a satellite needs more power, passes into darkness or faces a power emergency – plus the power conditioning and distribution electronics keeping all parts of a mission"

We will be taking a look back at the important work done during the last three decades during this month’s European Space Power Conference.” The 12th European Space Power Conference (ESPC) is taking take place in Juan-les-Pins, Côte d'Azur, France, from 30 September to 4 October, with almost 400 participants. Véronique is chairing the event. “It will begin 30 years to the week from the very first conference in the series,” adds ESA power conditioning engineer Mariel Triggianese, ESPC’s technical coordinator. “So we’ll be commemorating our past but also looking forward.

Previous circuits on chips rely on electrons as the information carriers. In the future, photons which transmit information at the speed of light will be able to take on this task in optical circuits. Quantum light sources, which are then connected with quantum fiber optic cables and detectors are needed as basic building blocks for such new chips. First step towards optical quantum computers: ""This constitutes a first key step towards optical quantum computers,"" says Julian Klein, lead author of the study. ""Because for future applications the light sources must be coupled with photon circuits, waveguides for example, in order to make light-based quantum calculations possible."" The critical point here is the exact and precisely controllable placement of the light sources. It is possible to create quantum light sources in conventional three-dimensional materials such as diamond or silicon, but they cannot be precisely placed in these materials. Deterministic defects: The physicists then used a layer of the semiconductor molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the starting material, just three atoms thick. They irradiated this with a helium ion beam which they focused on a surface area of less than one nanometer. In order to generate optically active defects, the desired quantum light sources, molybdenum or sulfur atoms are precisely hammered out of the layer. The imperfections are traps for so-called excitons, electron-hole pairs, which then emit the desired photons. Technically, the new helium ion microscope at the Walter Schottky Institute's Center"

On the road to new light sources: Together with theorists at TUM, the Max Planck Society, and the University of Bremen, the team developed a model which also describes the energy states observed at the imperfections in theory. In the future, the researchers also want to create more complex light source patterns, in lateral two-dimensional lattice structures for example, in order to thus also research multi-exciton phenomena or exotic material properties. This is the experimental gateway to a world which has long only been described in theory within the context of the so-called Bose-Hubbard model which seeks to account for complex processes in solids. Quantum sensors, transistors and secure encryption: And there may be progress not only in theory, but also with regard to possible technological developments. Since the light sources always have the same underlying defect in the material, they are theoretically indistinguishable. This allows for applications which are based on the quantum-mechanical principle of entanglement. ""It is possible to integrate our quantum light sources very elegantly into photon circuits,"" says Klein. ""Owing to the high sensitivity, for example, it is possible to build quantum sensors for smartphones and develop extremely secure encryption technologies for data transmission."" 10 July 2019: ESA’s technical heart will be serving as a testbed for this driverless shuttle in the coming months.

While many governments invest heavily in inspection and maintenance programs, the number of bridges that are coming to the end of their design lives or that have significant structural damage can outpace the resources available to repair them. But infrastructure managers may soon have a new way to identify the structures most at risk of failure. Scientists, led by Pietro Milillo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have developed a new technique for analyzing satellite data that can reveal subtle structural changes that may indicate a bridge is deteriorating - changes so subtle that they are not visible to the naked eye. In August 2018, the Morandi Bridge, near Genoa, Italy, collapsed, killing dozens of people.

Using a new process, they were able to detect millimeter-size changes to the bridge over time that would not have been detected by the standard processing approaches applied to spaceborne synthetic aperture radar observations. They found that the deck next to the bridge's collapsed pier showed subtle signs of change as early as 2015; they also noted that several parts of the bridge showed a more significant increase in structural changes between March 2017 and August 2018 - a hidden indication that at least part of the bridge may have become structurally unsound. ""This is about developing a new technique that can assist in the characterization of the health of bridges and other infrastructure,"" Millilo said. ""We couldn't have forecasted this particular collapse because standard assessment techniques available at the time couldn't detect what we can see now. But going forward, this technique, combined with techniques already in use, has the potential to do a lot of good."" The technique is limited to areas that have consistent synthetic aperture radar-equipped satellite coverage. In early 2022, NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) plan to launch the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR), which will greatly expand that coverage. Designed to enable scientists to observe and measure global environmental changes and hazards, NISAR will collect imagery that will enable engineers and scientists to investigate the stability"

The majority of the SAR data for this study was acquired by the Italian Space Agency's COSMO-Skymed constellation and the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Sentinel-1a and -1b satellites. The research team also used historical data sets from ESA's Envisat satellite. The study was recently published in the journal Remote Sensing. 27 June 2019: Everyday transitions from one state of matter to another—such as freezing, melting or evaporation—start with a process called ""nucleation,"" in which tiny clusters of atoms or molecules (called ""nuclei"") begin to coalesce. Nucleation plays a critical role in circumstances as diverse as the formation of clouds and the onset of neurodegenerative disease. A UCLA-led team has gained a never-before-seen view of nucleation—capturing how the atoms rearrange at 4-D atomic resolution (that is, in three dimensions of space and across time). The findings, published in the journal Nature, differ from predictions based on the classical theory of nucleation that has long appeared in textbooks. ""This is truly a groundbreaking experiment—we not only locate and identify individual atoms with high precision, but also monitor their motion in 4-D for the first time,"" said senior author Jianwei ""John"" Miao, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy, who is the deputy director of the STROBE National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center and a member of the California"

The sample is rotated, and in much the same way a CAT scan generates a three-dimensional X-ray of the human body, atomic electron tomography creates stunning 3D images of atoms within a material. Miao and his colleagues examined an iron-platinum alloy formed into nanoparticles so small that it takes more than 10,000 laid side by side to span the width of a human hair. To investigate nucleation, the scientists heated the nanoparticles to 520 º Celsius ( 968º Fahrenheit), and took images after 9 minutes, 16 minutes and 26 minutes. At that temperature, the alloy undergoes a transition between two different solid phases."

The overall objective is to provide high-resolution radar imagery to German defense forces over a period of ten years starting in 2006. SAR-Lupe is in fact the first dedicated reconnaissance satellite imaging project of Germany. More specific objectives are: • To provide an event monitoring observation capability independent of weather and illumination conditions, in particular for regions of crisis or emergency situations (such as natural disaster coverage) to support the government in the assessment of intelligence information • To assist the military to plan and to prepare operations • To support deployed forces with frequent event-driven intelligence information.

Background: Germany's development of this program was directly related to its experiences during the NATO action in Kosovo (1998-1999), particularly to difficulties in getting the US to share satellite intelligence of direct relevance to the protection and security of non-US allied forces. These experiences convinced Germany of the need for its own spaceborne intelligence-gathering assets to deal with crisis management. In October 2003, the BWB tasked OHB-System to conduct a second-phase study focusuing on the specifics of SAR-Lupe and Helios II operating in tandem. The study involved arriving at a detailed description of the needed technical adjustments to the SAR-Lupe ground station and the precise interfaces required, as well as a clear understanding of program costs and schedules. OHB-System undertook its initial hardware tests involving a radar transmitter tube in November 2002. The company and the BWB completed the CDR (Critical Design Review) of the system during the first half of 2003. The engineering test model for the SAR-Lupe satellite was completed by 2004 in OHB-System's Bremen integration facility, which includes a radome.

The PISat project actually consists of a consortium of Indian colleges, with the support of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) and IE (Institution of Engineers) of India,to provide a hands-on environment for students in all aspects of satellite building and operations. Spacecraft: PISat is a nanosatellite of size 254 x 256 x 181 mm and a mass of 5.3 kg. The spacecraft is equipped with an imaging instrument to capture imagery of Earth's surface. ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem): PISAT is a three axis stabilized satellite with active magnetic control system. The attitude sensors onboard are tri-axial MEMS based IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and FPSS (Four Pi steradian Sun Sensors). The IMU used onboard is ADIS16405 (Figure 3) from Analog Devices Inc. that includes a tri-axial gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer. The tri -axial magnetometer maximum range is about ±3,50,000 nT, initial sensitivity of 50 nT and initial bias error of ±400 nT. The factory calibration characterizes each sensor for sensitivity, bias, alignment, and linear acceleration. The ADCS includes MTRs (Magnetic Torque Rods) as actuators; they produce magnetic dipole moments, which interact with the Earth’s magnetic field to generate torques on the satellite. PISAT is aiming at a pointing accuracy of 5º, hence active magnetic control is adequate to satisfy the mission requirement. The PISAT ADCS operating modes"

The orbit model provides the state vectors (position and velocity) in ECI (Earth Centered Inertial) and ECF (Earth Centered Fixed) reference frames. For the onboard attitude determination using magnetometer data, it is necessary to compute orbital parameters viz. declination, longitude, argument of perigee, true anomaly, inclination, in order to calculate the reference field vector components in orbit frame. OBC (On Board Computer): The OBC consists of an Atmel 32 bit microcontroller AVR32- AT32UC3A0512 (MC) with built in Flash PROM, RAM, ADC, PWMs and timers, with the clock speed of 12 MHz. The primary role of the PISAT OBC is to control all subsystems of the satellite. The most important tasks performed by the PISAT OBC are: • Receive and respond to commands from the ground station as well as to handle the general housekeeping of the satellite. • Collect the telemetry data, format and encode the data for transmitting to the ground station. • Onboard attitude determination by monitoring Earth’s magnetic field and control operations using control algorithms. • Store payload data and playback telemetry data during non-visible period for transmission to ground during visibility. Interface between NanoCam and OBC: - Nanocam runs on free RTOS and supports FTP for data transfer. - OBC runs on custom RTE (Real Time Executive) developed by students at PESIT. - Providing support for FTP on OBC is non trivial. - GomSpace provided a new firmware on Nanocam that allows access to memory on Nanocam using the"

NanoCam: NanoCam is a CMOS color camera for Earth observation experimentation manufactured by GomSpace of Aalborg, Denmark. NanoCam is a flexible and modular system to rapidly implement tailored imaging systems based on costumer requirements. The “NanoCam C1U” is an off-the shelf configuration of the NanoCam system, consisting of: Lens, lens table, image acquisition board, image processing board and software. NanoCam C1U has been designed to be implementable in an ISIS 1U cubesat structure together with GomSpace’s onboard computers, attitude control system, radio transceiver and power products to allow low cost Earth observation using cubesats. The C1U is based in an industrial ruggedized lens from Schneider Optics. The lens mounts in the lens table, which is the main load bearing part of the system. The image sensor is located at the top side of the camera printed circuit board beneath the lens table and interfaces to the image processor and memory components on the back side of the board. NanoCam has a 3MP 10 bit color CMOS based detector and acquires the image at a resolution of 2048 H x 1536 V pixel. This covers about 165 km x 125 km for a spatial resolution of 80 m. The imaging CMOS detector, with a frame rate of 12 frame/s, gives a total capture time of 83.3 ms.

The communication interface between the OBC and the payload is via I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuits) which is a serial communication protocol. It supports communication between multiple devices connected to the same bus of two lines (data and clock) and data transmission speeds up to 400 kbit/s. All commands and their responses are sent using this interface. The main connector to the satellite bus is a high grade 15 pin Bi-Lobe from Omnetics P/N A29100-015. The connector mates with P/N A28000-15 (included with NanoCam). In addition, there is a Molex PicoBlade 12 pin connector for JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) access and debugging used to upload new firmware and accessing the debugging serial port without using the main flight connector. Pins 1-8 are pin-to-pin compatible with the JTAG port on all other GomSpace products (from mid 2011-), and pins 9-12 are compatible with the debugging connector on all GomSpace products. The two functions are brought together in one connector on NanoCam due to its limited size. The NanoCam device has a total mass of 166 gram. 3) Information provided by Prof. Divya Rao of PESIT (PES Institute of Technology), Bangalore, India.

There have been a few demonstrations of video imaging capability most notable on the TUBSAT series of missions, and more recently from the space station by Urthecast (Ref. 6). Video imaging is generally only of interest if the resolution is good enough. For most applications this means that very high resolution (metric scale or better) is required. This poses challenges on the spacecraft in terms of instrument size, platform attitude stability, and geolocation. Also, most applications for video require regular revisit to a particular location. Daily opportunities are probably a minimum requirement, and multiple opportunities per day support a much wider range of applications. As such constellations of satellites become essential in any video imaging system implementation. Carbonite-1 is a technology demonstration microsatellite mission of SSTL , designed to demonstrate rapid-build techniques and to test COTS components and new avionics in orbit. In 2014, based on earlier studies, SSTL decided to build a prototype, very low cost, high resolution satellite as an in-house technology demonstrator mission. This would become the leading satellite in a new class of in-orbit demonstrator missions aimed at trialing new advanced concepts for use in future missions. To keep costs to a minimum and to make use of an existing launch opportunity, the satellite had to be developed and built in six months. The decision to start was taken on the 1st July 2014 and"

This was followed by nearly two months of environmental testing, with the satellite ready to launch within eight months from start. Merits of DMC3 and Carbonite: The DMC3 and Carbonite series of spacecraft are two sides of the same coin: one provides high fidelity imagery and the other provides high utility; but they both provide high resolution imagery. DMC3 is designed to provide high precision pointing capability with fast slewing in order to acquire multiple targets within a single pass. The images captured provide a high degree of precision with respect to the scene being captured. This enables the continuation of many of the commercial applications that have already been established which include: agriculture, deforestation, land use, and disaster monitoring. The Carbonite series of spacecraft provide high utility by reducing the cost of entry for new and existing business models which includes the deployment of super-constellations. The addition of video capability from a large constellation can lead to new use cases which include persistent monitoring of regional hot spots for change detection. By reducing the cost and schedule per satellite, the Carbonite series can enable these super-constellations thereby providing a unique ability for sub-daily accesses. It will also enable new opportunities and bolster the capabilities of DMC3 type missions by providing higher revisit at a lower cost. This has the potential of disrupting the market by opening up new service areas with new applications that require a high revisit frequency, supplemented with high fidelity imagery, by providing"

Spacecraft: To achieve the challenging schedule and price targets, the satellite design is based on five key principles: • Image quality to be ""good enough"" for the intended application • Single string (except for the receivers that are hot redundant) • Extensive use of COTS components, including in the imager • Simple, non-optimized structure • Use of existing technical solutions whenever possible. The project organization was based around a very small core team of 5 engineers, substantially increasing decision speed. The team was given full autonomy to decide and implement the best solutions, within the wide boundaries set by the business. The SSTL-X50 platform builds on three decades of experience at SSTL to realize a low-cost satellite bus for a wide range of missions, satisfying the lifetime requirements for Earth Observation and LEO communications operators. The main difference is the structure is built around the telescope using central shear walls made of milled aluminum. The avionics equipment was mounted to the shear walls around the imager. The closure and solar panels were made of sandwiched honeycomb panels.The size of the SSTL-X50 platform is 65 x 65 x 72 cm. The camera is based on a CMOS detector and provides color imagery with a GSD (Ground Sample Distance) of 1.5 m at an altitude of 650 km. The satellite can generate still images or videos of the area of interest. By flying the satellite at a lower altitude the GSD can be improved to 1 m. Launch: The Carbonite-1 satellite was launched"

For some of these missions potential service providers and end-users work in partnership with SSTL (Ref. 6). - Carbonite-2 results have already validated the approach to video imaging constellations and a range of applications, and paves the way for implementing full production spacecraft and constellations. - Future iterations of the Carbonite-1 and -2 video imaging spacecraft are planned to be optimized for batch production to reduce mass and volume further, for implementation of a cost-effective constellation. Furthermore, the video imaging capability is also planned to be included as a separate capability onto the SSTL-300S1 and SSTL-1000S50 high resolution imaging spacecraft. - In summary: Video imaging applications require constellations of very low cost, high-performance spacecraft. The highly bespoke design and production of satellites that has dominated the satellite industry would not be appropriate for such a constellation, and spacecraft addressing video imaging applications must be designed for batch production. The greatest risk for such batch production runs is the inadvertent introduction of systematic design faults and issues, and service demonstrators become essential in order to mitigate such risks. - Carbonite-1 demonstrated that the concept of a COTS imaging payload is viable, and led to a range of lessons learned that were then implemented on a second Carbonite-2 pilot service demonstrator mission. - Carbonite-2 has returned high quality results which can give owner operators confidence that high resolution video imaging constellations can"

The satellite is still being used to test out new improved AOCS and imaging techniques and to build heritage on the payload equipment. - The Carbonite-1 and -2 microsatellites launched in 2015 and 2018, respectively, are delivering high-resolution, high-definition color video from space, providing a new dimension to Earth Observation and ""big data"" analytics. Single video imaging spacecraft have limited utility. In order to fully benefit from such spacecraft requires cost-effective observations with multiple opportunities per target per day, driving the need for large-scale constellations of ultra-low cost spacecraft. The first constellation based on the two pilot missions is now in production, and will start commercial operation by 2020. Still-imagery has a number of limitations in applications related to surveillance, disaster monitoring and news gathering. Video can provide additional contextual information, and space borne video systems have been demonstrated several times over the past decades. Single video imaging spacecraft in LEO are limited in application, as they cannot cover specific target areas on the globe frequently enough. Furthermore, previous video imaging missions have generally lacked the necessary resolution to allow fine scale human activity to be monitored, such as traffic and crowds. - The spacecraft will now be used to demonstrate real operational scenarios with data being shared with key mission partners.

Note: More detail of the Carbonite-2 spacecraft and the sensor complement will be provided when the information becomes available. With the enhanced AOCS, several imaging modes are supported in snapshot and video mode. These include Stripmap, Stereo pair, and mosaic imaging. In video mode target tracking mode is also supported. In strip mapping mode, video imaging results in a number of overlapping scenes providing opportunities to address applications for low light or high quality imaging through image processing of the combined overlapping scenes."

Conventional wisdom would suggest that small satellites are not well suited to this mission profile: the laws of diffraction dictate that to obtain a higher spatial resolution, a larger aperture is required, whereas small satellites are by definition limited in volume. This problem is exacerbated by video, where exposure time and therefore the signal-to-noise ratio of the resultant video are highly constrained. The Carbonite-2 mission reconciles these challenges by leveraging principles of computational photography and the latent richness in the data collected. The video collected by Carbonite-2 is enhanced in software through ground processing, through corrections derived from ground and on-orbit characterization, as well as by exploiting the high redundancy in this video data and the contextual information inherent in its high resolution. In-orbit results demonstrated that this approach can result in a spacecraft that can address a range of novel video imaging applications so far hardly explored and exploited in previous Earth Observation Missions (Ref. 6). The block diagram for the image processing chain for Carbonite-2 is shown in Figure 10. The image processing chain corrects for the measured radiometric performance of the sensor, and supports both strip mapping as well as video imaging. - The ground processing also exploits the high redundancy inherent in the resulting video data, and the contextual information inherent in its high resolution.

A NIR filter was applied to change the imager spectral response on Carbonite-2. On the ground, fixed pattern noise, dark current and noise, and read noise were measured by capturing images with the camera's lens cap on, such that the sensor was shielded from light. A raw image that represents this is shown in Figure 11. The fixed pattern noise (FPN), which represents how the bias of the sensor changes from pixel to pixel, was measured on-ground by capturing and averaging a series of 50 dark images, each containing 10 µs exposure time. This was the minimum configurable exposure time, and serves to minimize the effects of dark current. Further exposures of 7 seconds also help characterize the effect of exposure time, so that ultimately images can be corrected accordingly. Sensor Read Noise was characterized by subtracting the FPN from the minimum exposure dark images, resulting in a standard deviation of 2.48 ADU (Analog-to-Digital conversion Unit), which was assumed to be equivalent to the read noise and closely matches datasheet specifications. Dark Current was measured by placing the image sensor in a temperature controlled chamber and capturing dark images at different stable temperatures, and at different exposure times. Only one dark image was captured at each of these exposure times, along with a bias frame was using the minimum possible exposure time (10 µs), such that each dark image could be"

Measurements showed that there is negligible dark current across the operational temperature and exposure ranges which also matches datasheet specifications. The sensor's datasheet has indicated that its dynamic response is linear, except very near to saturation. This was also qualitatively verified by capturing images from an integrating sphere with many different exposure times, and examining the response of a single pixel (the radiance of which is constant across images). As a result the dynamic range was established to be 52.3dB, which is 4dB worse than the typical value stipulated on the sensor datasheet. The photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) represents how the gain of the image sensor changes from pixel to pixel. This was measured by imaging an integrating sphere with a transmissive diffuser over the output port. Likewise, the image sensor was brought as close to the integrating sphere as possible, such that its housing was touching the diffuser, to ensure a flat field of radiance at the sensor. Images were also captured with the image sensor at different angles and averaged to mitigate any systematic effects induced by the apparatus. Thus, the averaged image has been assumed to roughly represent the PRNU. The signal to noise ratio of the image sensor was verified by scanning an 8 x 8 pixel window across the images captured from the integrating sphere as described for the PRNU determination, for each color channel separately. No attempt was made to correct images for FPN or PRNU due to the artefacts contained in each, and the use of a small"

The radiance was assumed to be a flat field across this window. The signal-to-noise ratio was then determined by taking the ratio of the mean signal and the standard deviation of the signal in this window (both in ADU). The resulting SNR plots confirm datasheet figures and can be used to evaluate the in-orbit performance of the imager that is achieved. In-orbit results show good agreement with radiometric models used during the instrument design. Carbonite-2 In-Orbit Results Carbonite-2 was launched on 12 January 2018. As part of the commissioning campaign, the spacecraft was contacted from the SSTL groundstation in Surrey on the first pass to start platform checkout and detumble the spacecraft and bring it under 3-axis control. The UHD instrument includes a focusing mechanism, and payload commissioning in video imaging mode while moving the focusing mechanism allows very rapid instrument focusing to be achieved. In order to find the best focus in-orbit, a coarse focus sweep was performed whilst imaging on two different acquisitions over Doha and Mumbai. The direction of the sweep was opposite in order to reduce uncertainty with residual backlash. A total focus range of ± 940 µm was covered during the sweep of 200,000 steps in the range. As the payload is changing focus whilst imaging, the image quality changes from blurred to sharp to blurred again and the point where it is the sharpest is called 'best focus'.

However, this system is not enough to prevent message collisions in case of SPAISE. Satellites have large footprints (i.e. vast visibilities) including many maritime SOTDMA (Self Organized Time Division Multiple Access) cells. Hence, message collisions coming from some signals from different cells are caused by the large area of satellite FOV (Field of View) as shown in Figure 11. The collision problem reduces the probability of getting the proper information of ships. • The Doppler shift issue: The frequency of AIS carriers is effected the Doppler shift of about - 4 kHz to + 4 kHz. The Doppler shift is due to velocity difference between satellites and ships. A satellite in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) moves at speeds of ~7 km/s. In contrast, the speed of a Class A ship is very small. This difference causes the Doppler effect - and requires to tune the frequency band of the satellite AIS receiver. • The Faraday rotation issue: When linearly polarized waves are entering the ionosphere, the polarization planes are rotated by the Faraday effect, referred to as Faraday rotation, which depends primarily on frequency of the signals. The amount of rotation of the polarization angles is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency. The planes of polarization of the AIS signals are affected by Faraday rotation, due to the fact that the AIS signals are linearly polarized waves as defined by ITU. The antennas receiving"

This method intends to collect waveform data of AIS signals for signal analysis on the ground. Signal analysis system is under development now. It is expected to extract AIS data from overlap messages. Figure 15 shows the configuration of the sampling method. In this method, the sampled data are transmitted directly, without an intermediate storage, from the spacecraft transmitter to the ground stations. Obviously, a considerable amount of computing power is needed to support the real-time sampling method. The payload antennas make up a"

When ships lock up at the satellite, the polarization planes of satellite antennas are orthogonal. The data of the AIS signals received in space is transmitted by transmitters of the satellite using QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation and the USB (Unified S-band). The data rates are depended on a type of transmission methods. For the USB method it is 16 kbit/s, for the QPSK method the data rate is 1 Mbit/s. The store & forward method can use both types. However, the sampling method uses only the QPSK transmission, because the sampled data are enormous in volume. The SPAISE technology demonstration represents an important step for maritime traffic surveillance and in spaceborne observations in Japan. After the experiment, the next generation AIS receiver will be developed for a future network FOX (Flat-plate heat pipe On-orbit Experiment): The FHP (Flat-plate Heat Pipe) has a flat shape, which enables the transfer of exhaust heat from the narrow clearance between components and the structure. This experiment is intended to demonstrate and confirm the FHP performance in a micro-gravity environment.

THERME has a heritage experiment - flying currently on French missions like SPOT-5 (launch in May 2002), HELIOS-2A (launch Dec. 2004), and DEMETER (launch June 2004). THERME aims to evaluate the ageing of thermal coatings (evolution of solar absorptivity αs), especially of recent thermal coatings. The IST on SDS‐4 involves two THERME units, each provided with two kinds of samples: CNES samples and JAXA samples. - The CNES samples are two kinds of white paints, i.e., ""SG122FD"" on a polyimide substrate and ""PSBN"" on an aluminum substrate. - The JAXA samples are thermal control films, i.e., aluminized AO‐tolerant polyimide film ""BSF‐30"" with/without UV protective coating. Each sample is 60mm x 60mm in size, resulting in a size of 120 mm x 60 mm on each THERME unit.

An important aspect of the mission is that GOLD will be one of the first NASA science missions to fly as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite. This is by far the most cost-effective way to put a science instrument into geostationary orbit, where it can observe nearly a full hemisphere of the Earth all of the time. The goal of the GOLD imaging mission is the study of the boundary layer between Earth and space and to address four primary science questions: 1) How do geomagnetic storms alter the temperature and composition structure of the thermosphere? 2) What is the global-scale response of the thermosphere to solar extreme-ultraviolet variability? 3) How significant are the effects of atmospheric waves and tides propagating from below on thermospheric temperature structure? 4) How does the nighttime equatorial ionosphere influence the formation and evolution of equatorial plasma density irregularities?

Spacecraft: SES-14 is a geostationary communications satellite operating in C- and Ku-bands across the Americas and the North Atlantic region, which uses electric propulsion for initial orbit raising and all on-orbit maneuvers. The spacecraft is being built by Airbus Space and Defence, based on the Eurostar E3000 EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) platform, which exclusively uses electric propulsion for orbit raising. SES-14 will replace SES's satellite NSS-806 and add new capacity. The satellite combining power and flexibility will have a double mission. The first will be a wide-beam payload of C- and Ku-band, covering the Americas plus a link to Europe. The other payload, called HTS (High Throughput Satellite) with numerous user beams, will combine an on-board processor with multi-beam coverage of the Americas and the North Atlantic. The Ku-band wide beams will bring augmented capacity to serve growing video neighborhoods in the Americas and support existing VSAT services. The HTS Ku-band multi-spot beams (20) are ideal for traffic-intensive data applications such as mobile backhaul, maritime and aeronautical services. SES-14 will carry seven antennas. It will have a take-off weight of 4,200 kg and an electric power of 16 kW.

Airbus Defence and Space has been using electric propulsion for station keeping for more than ten years, and is building the first large satellites using only electric propulsion for initial orbit raising. GOLD will transmit data from a geostationary orbit at a fast pace, to build up a full-disk view every half hour, providing detailed large-scale measurements of the response of the upper atmosphere to forcing from the Sun, the magnetosphere, and the lower atmosphere. Hosted GOLD payload: Flying as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite, GOLD takes advantage of the resource margins available in the early years of the commercial mission’s planned 15-year life. This hosted payload approach is a pathfinder for cost-effective NASA science missions. The affordable ride to GEO makes it possible for an Explorer-class Mission of Opportunity to perform FUV (Far UltraViolet) imaging of nearly a complete hemisphere on a 30-minute cadence. This global-scale, high-cadence imaging will enable GOLD to distinguish between spatial and temporal variations in the TI (Thermosphere Ionosphere) system caused by geomagnetic storms, variations in solar EUV, and forcing from the lower atmosphere. The most significant difference between developing instrumentation for a NASA-owned mission and accomplishing the same task for a commercial satellite is that communications satellites are procured on a faster schedule - 24 to 36 months from satellite contract to launch - than the instrument development.

Launched in 2018 aboard the SES-14 communications satellite, GOLD looks down on Earth’s upper atmosphere from what’s known as geosynchronous orbit, effectively “hovering” over the western hemisphere as Earth turns. GOLD’s unique position gives it a stable view of one entire face of the globe – called the disk – where it scans the temperature of Earth’s upper atmosphere every 30 minutes. - “We found results that were not previously possible because of the kind of data that we get from GOLD,” said Fazlul Laskar, who led the research. Dr. Laskar is a research associate at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. - From its perch some 35,786 kilometers above us, GOLD looks down on the thermosphere, a region of Earth’s atmosphere between about 53 and 373 miles (85 and 600 km) high. The thermosphere is home to the aurora, the International Space Station, and the highest temperatures in Earth’s atmosphere, up to 2,700 °F (1,500 °C). It reaches such incredible temperatures by absorbing the Sun’s high-energy X-rays and extreme ultraviolet rays, heating the thermosphere and stopping these types of light from making it to the ground. - But the"

Laskar and his collaborators compared days with more geomagnetic activity to days with less, and found an increase of over 160 °F (90 °C) in thermospheric temperatures. Magnetic disturbances, driven by the Sun, were heating up Earth’s hottest atmospheric layer. - Some amount of heating was expected near Earth’s poles, where a weak point in our magnetic field allows some solar wind to pour into our upper atmosphere. But GOLD’s data showed temperature increases across the whole globe – even near the equator, far from any incoming solar wind. - Laskar and colleagues suggest it has to do with changing circulation patterns. There’s a swirling of air high above us — a global circulation that pushes air from the equator up to the poles and back around at lower altitudes. As the solar wind pours into the thermosphere near the poles, the added energy can alter this circulation pattern, driving winds and atmospheric compression that can raise temperatures even far away. - Changing circulation might also underlie another surprise finding. GOLD’s data showed the amount of heat added depended on the time of day. The team discovered a stronger effect in the morning hours compared to that in the afternoon. They suspect that geomagnetic activity might especially strengthen the circulation during"

This allows GOLD to watch the same area for changes over time across longitude and latitude, something that most satellites studying the upper atmosphere can’t do. - “Since GOLD is on a geostationary satellite, we can capture 2D time evolution of these dynamics,” said Dr. Xuguang Cai, a researcher at the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado, and lead author on a new research paper. - GOLD focuses on parts of Earth’s upper atmosphere stretching from about 50 to 400 miles in altitude, including a neutral layer called the thermosphere and the electrically charged particles that make up the ionosphere."
0,GOLD |  |,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/gold,EoPortal,EoPortal,Mission status 4,"Unlike the neutral particles in most of Earth’s atmosphere, the ionosphere’s charged particles respond to the electric and magnetic fields threading through the atmosphere and near-Earth space. But because the charged and neutral particles are mixed together, something that influences one population can also impact the other. - This means the ionosphere and upper atmosphere are shaped by a host of complex factors, including space weather conditions – such as geomagnetic storms, driven by the Sun – and terrestrial weather. These regions also act as a highway for many of our communications and navigation signals. Changes in the ionosphere’s density and composition can muddle the signals passing through, like radio and GPS. - From its vantage point on a commercial communications satellite in geostationary orbit, GOLD makes hemisphere-wide observations of the ionosphere about every 30 minutes. This unprecedented birds-eye view is giving scientists new insights into how this region changes. Mysterious movement - One of the nighttime ionosphere’s most distinctive features are twin bands of dense charged particles on either side of Earth’s magnetic equator. These bands – called the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) – can change in size, shape, and intensity, depending on the conditions in the ionosphere. - The bands can also move position. Until now, scientists have relied on data captured by satellites passing through the region, averaging measurements over months to see just how the bands might be shifting in the long term. But short-term changes were more difficult to track. - Before GOLD, scientists suspected that any quick changes that happen"

If the northern band moves north, the southern band makes a mirror motion south. One night in November 2018, though, GOLD saw something that challenged this idea: the southern band of particles drifted southward, while the northern band remained steady – all in less than two hours. - This isn’t the first time scientists have seen the bands move like this, but this shorter event – only about two hours, compared to a more typical six to eight hours seen prior – was seen for the first time, and could only have been observed by GOLD. The observations are outlined in a paper published on Dec. 29, 2020, in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics. - The symmetrical drifting of these bands is caused by rising air that drags charged particles along with it. As night falls and temperatures cool, warmer pockets of air surge upwards. The charged particles carried within these warmer air pockets are bound by magnetic field lines, and for those pockets near Earth’s magnetic equator the shape of Earth’s magnetic field means that upward motion also pushes the charged particles horizontally. This creates the symmetrical northward and southward drift of the two charged particle bands. - The exact cause of the asymmetric drift observed by GOLD is still a mystery – though Cai suspects the answer lies in some combination of the many factors that shape the motion of electrons in the ionosphere: ongoing chemical reactions, electric fields, and high-altitude winds blowing through the region."

Because it’s impossible to observe every process with a satellite or ground-based sensor, scientists rely heavily on computer models to study the ionosphere, much like models that help meteorologists predict weather on the ground. To create these simulations, scientists code in what they suspect are the underlying physics at work and compare the model’s prediction to observed data. - Before GOLD, scientists got that data from occasional passing satellites and limited ground-based observations. Now, GOLD gives scientists a bird’s-eye view. • January 14, 2021: A special collection of research in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics highlights the initial accomplishments of NASA’s GOLD mission. GOLD, short for Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk, is an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph that observes Earth from its vantage point on a commercial communications satellite in geostationary orbit. - Since beginning science operations in October 2018, GOLD has kept a constant eye on Earth’s dynamic upper atmosphere, watching changes in the Western Hemisphere, marked by changes in the temperature, composition and density of the gases in this region. A few highlights include: - Results on one source of airglow seen at night, which relies on electrons on Earth’s day side becoming ionized by sunlight, then being transported along magnetic field lines to the nightside, where they create visible airglow (Solomon, et al) - New evidence supporting the idea that the equatorial ionization anomaly appearing in the early"

In addition, a significant enhancement (with respect to the baseline) in the ΣO/N2 column density ratio (~80%) was observed within the eclipse's totality. This enhancement suggests that the eclipse induced compositional changes in the thermosphere. After the eclipse passed, a slight enhancement in ΣO/N2 column density ratio (~7%) was also seen around the totality path when compared to measurements before the eclipse. These observations are the first synoptic imaging measurements of an eclipse's thermospheric effects with the potential to drastically improve and test our understanding of how the thermosphere responds to rapid, localized changes in solar short wavelength radiation. GOLD Observations of the 2019 Solar Eclipse - GOLD is a FUV imaging spectrometer (~133–165 nm) with three interchangeable entrance slits that can be selected to achieve different resolutions (0.21, 0.35, or 2.16 nm). GOLD also has two identical channels, each with its own mirror that can independently scan the Earth from a geostationary orbit above 47.5°W longitude. These mirrors are used to reflect light into one of the three entrance slits where the light gets dispersed. The spectral and spatial information of the dispersed light is then recorded and reduced. - GOLD makes daytime disk, limb, occultation, and nighttime disk measurements at different cadences. For this study, we used day disk imaging of the OI 135.6 nm and N2 LBH band emission brightnesses. The full disk day images were generated by scanning east to west starting from the northeastern limb and ending at the southwestern limb. Northern and Southern Hemisphere scans were made"

Data counts were then converted to radiance in Rayleighs (R) per nanometer. Integrating the radiance over the desired wavelength range gives the brightness in R (1R = 1010 photons m-2 s-1 steradian-1). Figure 17 shows an example of typical daytime 135.6 nm and LBH brightness imaging. Integration from 134 to 137 nm for the 135.6 nm emission and from 140 to 160 nm (excluding the N I 149.1 nm feature) for the LBH band emission was used to calculate the brightnesses. The scans in the Northern Hemisphere were made starting at 22:10 UT, while the southern scan started at 22:22 UT on 30 June 2019 (total cadence ~30 min). • December 26, 2019: High above the Earth, there is a dynamic region where the atmosphere meets space. Home to astronauts on the space station and to many Earth-observing and commercial satellites, the ionosphere constantly fluctuates and responds to changes from above and below. A NASA-funded instrument is shedding new light on the invisible processes and rhythms at play in this intersection between Earth and space. - Between 80 and 600 km above the ground, radiation from the Sun cooks some of the gases in our upper atmosphere until they lose an electron or two. The result is a sea of electrically charged particles—ions—intermingled with the neutral upper atmosphere. Energy is constantly streaming in from the Sun and from near-Earth space, an expression of what scientists call space weather. But the ionosphere also responds to"

Such changes can make it challenging to work in space, and they regularly affect key communications systems such as high-frequency (HF) radio and GPS. - According to atmospheric scientist Richard Eastes of the University of Colorado, the region is far more variable than scientists expected. That insight comes from work with the Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) instrument, which images the ionosphere in ultraviolet light to track changes in temperature, density, and composition. - Eastes noted that on one night, the crests may be evenly spaced over the equator; the next night, they can be far apart and in an entirely different position. The paths that radio waves take—such as those used by GPS—depend on the density of the ionosphere. Sometimes changes in the density and location of these hot spots can interfere with communications signals. - During such storms, the neutral atmosphere near the magnetic poles is heated by energy coming from the magnetosphere, and the density ratio decreases rapidly and dramatically. At lower latitudes, the opposite happens, as large amounts of atomic oxygen move from high to low latitudes. Since the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere are coupled, composition changes alter the ionosphere density and the behavior of radio communications signals. - Though some features like the Appleton anomaly are not new to scientists, the GOLD research team was surprised by how much the ionosphere varies from night to night. “These were very surprising findings to me, and to the"

Home to astronauts and everyday technology like radio and GPS, the ionosphere constantly responds to changes from space above and Earth below. - The collection of images presented include the first images from NASA’s ICON, new science results from NASA’s GOLD, and observations of a fleeting, never-before-studied aurora. Together, they bring color to invisible processes that have widespread implications for the part of space that is closest to home. - Earth’s ionosphere stretches from 50 to 400 miles above the ground and overlaps the top of the atmosphere and the very beginning of space. Radiation from the Sun cooks a small portion of gases in the upper atmosphere until they lose an electron or two. The result: a sea of electrically charged particles intermingled with the neutral upper atmosphere. - Besides energy streaming in from the Sun and near-Earth space, the ionosphere also responds to weather patterns that ripple up from the lower atmosphere below. These changes — which can impact astronauts and key communications systems — are complex and unpredictable. A range of specialized instruments is key to studying and understanding them.

GOLD Principal Investigator Richard Eastes, from the University of Colorado, Boulder, presented new results from the mission: observations that show the region is far more variable than scientists ever expected. - GOLD (Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk) is an instrument that images the ionosphere in far ultraviolet light. This particular wavelength of light is invisible to our eyes, but useful for tracking changes in the ionosphere’s temperature, density and composition. - Since GOLD can see the entire Western Hemisphere at once, it can observe ionospheric changes and patterns across the globe. In the past year, GOLD has helped scientists pin down how the ionosphere responds to geomagnetic storms: Atomic oxygen increases at low latitudes and decreases at high latitudes, while molecular nitrogen does the opposite. - GOLD’s unique vantage point also enabled observations of the July 2 total solar eclipse in South America. In typical day-night cycles, the pool of electrically charged atmospheric gases waxes and wanes with the Sun. During the day, the ionosphere is dense. At night, when the Sun is no longer energizing the atmosphere, the atmosphere cools. Charged particles gradually recombine. The ionosphere thins. In a total eclipse, the same thing happens over a much shorter amount of time. As the July 2 eclipse crossed over the bottom of South America, scientists were, for the first time, able to watch this thinning evolve across the Southern Hemisphere, from space. - The GOLD"

The paths that radio frequency waves take, such as those used by GPS, depend on the density of the ionosphere. Sometimes, changes in the density can interfere with these signals. - At night, charged particles tend to settle in crests beside Earth’s magnetic equator. Eastes likened the images to a T-rex’s toothy grin. On one night, the crests are evenly spaced over the equator, as if the T-rex is baring its teeth. The next night, the crests are far apart like the T-rex’s mouth is open wide, and the night after that, in a different position entirely. Why the nighttime ionosphere varies so much is still unclear. - “These were very surprising findings to me, and to the rest of the team who’s been looking at this stuff for many years,” Eastes said. “It’s not something we anticipated at all.” • August 13, 2019: NASA's GOLD (Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk) mission has observed dramatic and unexplained shifts in the location of features in the Earth’s ionosphere surrounding the equator. Unanticipated changes in the nighttime ionosphere can lead to disruptions in communication and navigation that depend on satellites, such as GPS. - GOLD is an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph that was designed and built at the University of Colorado Boulder’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) and is hosted on the SES-14 communications satellite.

One of the primary goals of the mission is to better understand the behavior of the EIA and the instabilities within it. GOLD presents a new ability to image the variability of ionospheric plasma and, ultimately, to understand its causes. - “The variability of the nighttime ionosphere has been a puzzle that scientists have studied for more decades than most of us have lived,” said Richard Eastes, GOLD principal investigator and LASP research scientist. “Today it’s an important problem to solve because better forecasts are needed for reliable navigation and communication by airplanes and others.” - Density variations in the ionosphere can cause localized plasma depletions called “bubbles.” Radio waves, including those used for communications and navigation, can be disrupted when they encounter these bubbles. The occurrence of bubbles and other ionospheric irregularities presents a critical challenge for efforts to predict how changes in solar and geomagnetic activity affect the nighttime ionosphere. - Because of GOLD’s unique perspective from geostationary orbit and its rapid imaging cadence (a complete scan of each hemisphere every 15 minutes), GOLD is providing new information that has not been available in previous EIA observations. From its geostationary vantage some 22,000 miles (35,786 km) above the Earth, GOLD observes the same longitudes repeatedly every night and provides large scale images of the EIA. - GOLD has"

From the lunar surface, they took a picture of Earth like none before: the first view of our planet in far ultraviolet light (Figure 24). - This picture highlights Earth’s ionosphere, a region of the upper atmosphere that is mostly invisible to our eyes — aside from aurora or airglow, if you’re in the right place at the right time — but shines in ultraviolet, or UV, wavelengths of light. Named for the electrically charged ions that move about freely there, the ionosphere absorbs UV light from the Sun and re-emits it to space. The effect can be seen in this UV image. The Sun-facing side of Earth is bright. The rest of the planet, which is not receiving UV light from the"

The two strips just above and below the equator are known as the Appleton Anomaly. They mark where Earth’s magnetic field interacts with the upper ionosphere to trigger dense fountains of uprising plasma. The southernmost strip is UV light from the aurora australis, or the Southern Lights. - Launched in 2018, NASA’s GOLD mission is now one of our key tools for ionosphere observations, providing the first day-to-day weather measurements of the region. By measuring far UV light, GOLD tracks changes in the ionosphere’s ever-changing temperature, density and composition — enabling scientists to piece together the forces that shape conditions in a part of the atmosphere critical to many Earth-orbiting satellites and everyday technology, including the successful transmission of radio signals and GPS. - This visualization of GOLD data from March 2019 shows the transition from day to night, as well as the Appleton anomaly, which appears as two horizontal arcs of light that extend into night.

During the Ariane 5 VA241 mission, carried out on January 25, 2018 from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana (South America), telemetry from the launcher was lost 9 minutes and 26 seconds into the flight because of a deviation in the trajectory. Signals from the two satellites were acquired after the nominal mission duration, and the spacecraft were confirmed to be in good health, but in an orbit at an inclination of 20 degrees, rather than the targeted 3 degrees. The apogee and perigee attitudes, however, were very close to the targeted values (249 x 45,234 km.). The analysis of data received during the first minutes of the flight, and the reconstitution of the trajectory, confirmed that the launcher and the flight program operated perfectly. The two satellites are now in the process of reaching their final orbital positions, using their own propulsion systems. Following the launch anomaly, Arianespace asked ESA (European Space Agency) on January 26 to set up an Independent Enquiry Commission. Chaired by Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA Inspector General, this Commission submitted its conclusions on Thursday, February 22, 2018. Investigations by the Independent Enquiry Commission showed that the trajectory anomaly resulted from an incorrect value in specifications for the implementation of the launcher’s two inertial reference systems. Given the special requirements of this mission, the azimuth required for the alignment of the inertial units was 70 degrees instead of 90 degrees, as is most often"

This gap led to the 20-degree shift to the south in the launcher trajectory from the initial seconds of flight. The cause of the trajectory deviation, therefore, was due to a bad specification of one of the launcher mission parameters that was not detected during the standard quality checks carried out during the Ariane 5 launches’ preparation chain. The Independent Enquiry Commission’s work has highlighted the need to increase the robustness of the control of certain data used in preparation of the mission. Its recommendations are intended to strengthen the process of developing and verifying the documents required for launcher preparation and to introduce additional consistency checks.

These interface to the SES-14 spacecraft through a single processor assembly, which commands each channel independently. Images produced by the instrument are routed to a dedicated transponder for immediate downlink to an SES ground station. The raw images are stored at the ground station until transmission to LASP is confirmed. These are then sent over ground line to the University of Central Florida where high-level data processing converts the raw data into maps of thermosphere composition and temperature.

Background: Cluster-I: The launch failure of Ariane-5 on June 4, 1996 with the Cluster satellites onboard and the ESA decision of a recovery program - are the reasons for a division into Cluster-I and Cluster-II programs. The Cluster-I launch on June 4, 1996 with the first Ariane-5 flight from Kourou turned out to be a failure. Ariane-5 rose flawlessly to an altitude of 3.5 km, at which point a sudden swivelling of both solid-booster nozzles caused the vehicle to tilt sharply. The resulting intense aerodynamic structural loads caused the rocket vehicle to break up, prompting the onboard safety systems to initiate self-destruction. The entire four-spacecraft mission was lost. Cluster-II program: In April 1997 ESA decided to go ahead with a recovery program, a new four-spacecraft mission, called Cluster-II, retaining all of the critical mission parameters. The Cluster-II mission comprises the Phoenix spacecraft (built with spares from the four original Cluster satellites) and three identical new satellites (construction and test of four S/C in 18 months, the industrial consortium was led by Astrium GmbH of Friedrichshafen, Germany). The overall objective is to investigate the physical interaction between the sun and the Earth, with four spacecraft flying in tetrahedral formation.

The two S/C of the first launch carry the names Salsa (S/C 2) and Samba (S/C 3); the spacecraft of second launch have the names Rumba (S/C 1) and Tango (S/C 4)."

Their observations explain how vortices at the edge of Earth's magnetosphere can cause auroral beads to dot the sky a hundred thousand kilometres below. - This connection between auroral beads appearing on Earth's ‘dayside' (or Sun-facing side) and the vortices confirms a theory about how these unique auroras – known as beads because they look like a string of pearls hung across the sky – form. As some spacecraft observed the vortices themselves, others saw that a stream of charged particles used the vortices as access points to tunnel down towards Earth's surface, causing the sky to glow. - The magnetosphere is Earth's defence against the charged particles and radiation blasted in our direction by the Sun (also known as the solar wind). This defence takes the form of a giant magnetic bubble in the shape of a shield facing the Sun.

Just as wind on Earth can whip up oceans and clouds, the solar wind can roll up the magnetopause into giant waves comprised of whirlpool-like vortices. - When a vortex is at the ‘goldilocks' size – not too big, but not too small – electrons from the solar wind swirl around its centre, before entering the magnetosphere, travelling towards and reaching Earth's upper atmosphere. There, the electrons collide with hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to glow and form an auroral bead in the sky. These round beads – one for each vortex – appear in groups that follow each other across the sky. This is in contrast to ‘normal' aurora which are flatter, more elongated and not so well organised. - One solar stormy day in November 2018, 13 spacecraft including ESA's Cluster mission were in the right place at the right time to spot a process that has never been seen in its entirety before.

This one life-enabling thing is Earth's powerful magnetosphere, which protects the planet from the bombardment by cosmic particles but also interacts with them, creating spectacular phenomena, such as polar lights. - Earth's magnetosphere, a tear drop-shaped region that begins some 65,000 km away from the planet on the day side and extends up to 6,300,000 km on the night side, is a result of the interaction between the planet's magnetic field, generated by the motions of its molten metal core, and the solar wind. Cluster is the first mission to have studied, modelled and three-dimensionally mapped this region and the processes within it in detail. By doing so, it helped to advance our understanding of space weather phenomena, which arise from the interplay between the magnetosphere and the energetic particles forming the solar wind. These phenomena can damage not only living organisms, but also electronic equipment, whether on the ground or in orbit. - The Cluster mission comprises four spacecraft flying in a pyramid-like formation on an elliptical polar orbit. The four spacecraft, called Rumba, Salsa, Samba and Tango, each carrying the same payload of 11 advanced instruments, were dispatched to orbit with two rocket launches on 16 July and 9 August 2000. - Although the mission has become an enormous success, having enabled numerous scientific breakthroughs, it's early days didn't go off without a hitch.

Polar power - While most missions exploring Earth's magnetic phenomena focus on the equator where many electric currents flow, the Cluster quartet circles the Earth in a polar orbit, which allows it to pass periodically above both Earth's poles. The polar regions are magnetically extremely dynamic. Solar wind in this area can penetrate deeper into Earth's upper atmosphere through the polar cusps, funnel-like openings in the magnetosphere above the poles, giving rise to the spectacular auroras. - Cluster's ability to observe higher latitudes than other missions made the mission a key player in forming a global magnetospheric map. - One element of this was accurately mapping the position and extent of so-called cold plasma (slow-moving charged particles) around Earth in three dimensions.

The mission identified that the magnetic field in this region oscillates in amplitude due to internal ‘kink-like' waves, and solved a long-standing mystery by determining that the phenomenon of ‘equatorial noise' (noisy plasma waves found near the equatorial plane of Earth's magnetic field) is generated by protons. - By investigating the spatial characteristics of the outer region of the magnetosphere, Cluster has brought a deeper understanding of how solar wind particles can penetrate our magnetic ‘shield'. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles flooding out into space from the Sun, moving at speeds of up to 2000 km/hour. Cluster identified tiny swirls of turbulence that affect how energy (heat) is distributed throughout this wind, and discovered that, while it protects us from incoming particles, our magnetosphere is quite porous and sieve-like, allowing super-heated solar wind particles to"

The mission also discovered the origin of so-called ‘killer electrons', energetic particles in Earth's outer belt of radiation that can cause havoc for satellites, by observing this process first-hand. Cluster found these electrons to arise as solar storm-related shock waves compress Earth's magnetic field lines, resulting in these lines vibrating and accelerating electrons to high, and dangerous, speeds. - Cluster has investigated the dynamics of a process known as magnetic reconnection, providing the first in situ observations of magnetic field lines breaking and reforming – a finding that required multiple simultaneous observations, as only Cluster could provide at the time. Cluster data also showed that energy is released in unexpected ways during reconnection events, helping scientists to build a fuller understanding of plasma dynamics. - Space weather and geomagnetic storms, phenomena driven by Earth's relationship with the Sun, have been a topic of focus for Cluster. The mission has modelled Earth's magnetic field at both low and high altitudes, and identified the complex dynamics at play in the solar wind itself, with the goal of enabling more informed and accurate ‘space weather forecasting'.

The storm itself is the eruption of electrically charged particles from the Sun's atmosphere. - A team led by Lucile Turc, a former ESA research fellow who is now based at the University of Helsinki, Finland, made the discovery after analyzing data from the Cluster Science Archive. The archive provides access to all data obtained during Cluster's ongoing mission over almost two decades. - Cluster consists of four spacecraft that orbit Earth in formation, investigating our planet's magnetic environment and its interaction with the solar wind – a constant flow of particles released by the Sun into the Solar System. - As part of their orbits, the Cluster spacecraft repeatedly fly through the foreshock, which is the first region that particles encounter when a solar storm hits our planet. The team found that in the early part of the mission, from 2001 to 2005, the spacecraft flew through six such collisions, recording the waves that were generated. - The new analysis shows that, during the collision, the foreshock is driven to release magnetic waves that are much more complex than first thought. - ""Our study reveals that solar storms profoundly modify the foreshock region,"" says Lucile. - When the frequencies of these magnetic waves are transformed into audible signals,"

When a solar storm hits, the frequency of the wave is roughly doubled, with the precise frequency of the resulting waves being dependent on the strength of the magnetic field in the storm. - ""It's like the storm is changing the tuning of the foreshock,"" explains Lucile. - And it doesn't stop there because not only does the frequency of the wave change but it also becomes much more complicated than the single frequency present in quiet times. Once the storm hits the foreshock, the wave breaks into a complex network of different, higher frequencies. - Computer simulations of the foreshock, performed using a model called Vlasiator, which is being developed at the University of Helsinki, demonstrate the intricate wave pattern that appears during solar storms. - The changes in the foreshock have the power to affect the way the solar storm is propagated down to the Earth's surface. Although it is still an open question exactly how this process works, it is clear that the energy generated by waves in the foreshock cannot escape back into space, as the waves are pushed towards Earth by the incoming solar storm. - Before they reach our atmosphere, however, the waves encounter another barrier, the bow shock,"

The collision of the magnetic waves modifies the behavior of the bow shock, possibly changing the way it processes the energy of the incoming solar storm. - Behind the bow shock, the magnetic fields of Earth start to resonate at the frequency of the waves and this contributes to transmit the magnetic disturbance all the way to the ground. It is a fast process, taking around ten minutes from the wave being generated at the foreshock to its energy reaching the ground. - Lucile and colleagues are now working to understand exactly how these complex waves are generated. - ""We always expected a change in frequency but not the level of complexity in the wave,"" she adds. Figure 19: Simulation of Earth's foreshock during a solar storm. This movie from the Vlasiator computer model shows the foreshock above Earth – the first region of our planet's magnetic environment that solar wind particles encounter – being engulfed by a magnetic cloud during a solar storm.

It is now more important than ever that we understand how space weather disturbances such as solar storms propagate through the Solar System and down to Earth, and ESA's upcoming Solar Orbiter mission, scheduled for launch in February 2020, will greatly contribute to these investigations. - This new scientific study based on the long-lived Cluster mission provides another detail in that knowledge but it also has a larger role to play in our understanding of the Universe. Magnetic fields are ubiquitous and so the kind of complex interaction seen in Earth's foreshock may take place in a variety of cosmic environments, including exoplanets orbiting close to their parent star, as they would be immersed in intense magnetic fields. - ""This is an excellent example of how Cluster continues to extend our knowledge of the Sun-Earth connection, even years after the original data was obtained,"" says Philippe Escoubet, ESA Project Scientist for Cluster.

The graph to the lower left relays the two sets of measurements of the magnetic field – one plotted in red (Cluster 3) and one in white (Cluster 4). Differences in the measured field provide evidence that small-scale magnetic field structures exist within the broader extent of the bow shock. These small structures are key in facilitating the breaking of plasma waves within the shock, and thus the transfer of energy, in this portion of Earth's magnetic environment. - There are several types of shock, defined by the ways in which they transfer kinetic energy into other kinds of energy. In Earth's atmosphere, kinetic energy is transformed into heat as particles collide with one another – but the vast distances at play at our planet's bow shock mean that particle collisions cannot play such a role in energy transfer there, as they are simply too far apart. - This type of shock is thus known as a collisionless shock. Such shocks can exist across a vast range of scales, from millimeters up to the size of a galaxy cluster, and instead transfer energy via processes involving plasma waves and electric and magnetic fields. - ""As well as being collisionless, Earth's bow"

It also defines our planet's magnetosphere, a region of space dominated by Earth's magnetic field and filled with energy that is topped up by the solar wind and sporadically released into the near-Earth environment. - With this comes ‘weather'. We occasionally experience magnetic storms and events that disturb and interact with Earth's radiation belts, atmosphere, and planetary surface. One of the most famous examples of this is the auroras that Earth experiences at its poles. These shimmering sheets of color form as the solar wind disrupts and breaches the upper layers of our atmosphere.   Figure 23: Bright aurora illuminating the sky over Norway (near Tromsø) on 17 February 2013 (image credit: ESA, S.

There are currently about 1800 active satellites circling our planet, and our dependence on space technology is only growing stronger. - ""This highlights a pressing need for more accurate space weather forecasts,"" says Philippe Escoubet, Project Scientist for ESA's Cluster mission.

This is what Cluster is helping us to do."" - Various spacecraft are investigating the magnetic environment around the Earth and how it interacts with the solar wind. Efforts have been internationally collaborative, from observatories including ESA's Cluster and Swarm missions, NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale mission (MMS), the Van Allen Probes, and THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms), and the Japanese (JAXA/ISAS) Arase and Geotail missions. Figure 24: The science of space weather: Earth's magnetosphere is a region of space dominated by our planet's magnetic field. The magnetosphere protects Earth from most of the solar wind, a flow of charged particles streaming out from the Sun. However, some particles are able to penetrate this shield and reach the ionosphere, giving rise to space weather effects, including the beautiful polar lights, or auroras, as well as geomagnetic storms. Space weather has a real impact on our activities on Earth, and poses a significant risk to spacefarers – robotic and human alike. Meanwhile, Sun-watching satellites like the ESA/NASA SOHO mission, located at the L1 point between Earth and the Sun, monitor coronal mass ejections leaving the Sun and measure the speed of the solar wind 1.5 million km away from our planet, about 1 hour before it reaches Earth (image credit: ESA) - Cluster comprises four identical spacecraft that fly in a pyramid-like formation, and is able to gather incredibly detailed data on the complex structure and fluctuations of our magnetic environment. - For nearly two decades, this quartet has mapped our magnetosphere and"

The mission also modelled the small-scale turbulence and intricate dynamics of the solar wind itself, and helped to explain the mysteries of Earth's auroras. - While this back catalog of discoveries is impressive enough, Cluster is still producing new insights, especially in the realm of space weather. Recently, the mission has been instrumental in building more accurate models of our planet's magnetic field both close to Earth (at so-called geosynchronous altitudes) and at large distances from Earth's surface – no mean feat. - In addition, ESA's Swarm mission is also providing insight into our planet's magnetic field. Launched in 2013 and comprising three identical satellites, Swarm has been measuring precisely the magnetic signals that stem from Earth's core, mantle, crust and oceans, as well as from the ionosphere and magnetosphere. - ""This kind of research is invaluable,"" adds Escoubet. ""Unexpected or extreme outbursts of space weather can badly damage any satellites we have in orbit around the Earth, so being able to keep better track of them – while simultaneously gaining a better understanding of our planet's dynamic magnetic field structure – is key to their safety."" - Cluster also recently tracked the impact of huge outbursts of highly energetic particles and photons from the outer layers of the Sun known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

Cluster explored a specific storm that occurred in September 2017, triggered by two consecutive CMEs separated by 24 hours. It studied how the storm affected the flow of charged particles leaving the polar regions of the ionosphere, a layer of Earth's upper atmosphere, above around 100 km, and found this flow to have increased around the polar cap by more than 30 times. This enhanced flow has consequences for space weather, such as increased drag for satellites, and is thought to be a result of the ionosphere being heated by multiple intense solar flares. - The mission has observed how various other phenomena affect our magnetosphere, too. It spotted tiny, hot, local anomalies in the flow of solar wind that caused the entire magnetosphere to vibrate, and watched the magnetosphere growing and shrinking significantly in size back in 2013, interacting with the radiation belts that encircle our planet as it did so. - Importantly, it also measured the speed of the solar wind at the ‘nose' of the bow shock. These observations connect data gathered near Earth to those obtained by Sun-watching satellites some 1.5 million km away at a location known as Lagrangian Point 1 – such as the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).

Among the flotilla of spacecraft that have been sent to investigate Earth from space are the four spacecraft of the Cluster mission. Since 2000, they have been tirelessly gathering vital data about the magnetic environment around our planet and, in the process, about one of the most important relationships in the Solar System: the physical connection between the Earth and the Sun. 17) - Cluster was the first mission to study the magnetosphere (the region where Earth's magnetic field dominates) in three dimensions and it has provided important clues about how this complex barrier shapes our atmosphere and interacts with the solar wind – the continuous stream of high-energy particles from the Sun. - The Cluster quartet – four identical spacecraft flying in a pyramid configuration – study the physical processes occurring within and around the magnetosphere. To better understand this region is to better understand how life was and is possible on our planet. Cluster data also provide essential insights for safe air travel, space travel and effective"

The Cluster fleet, however, occupies a polar orbit, sweeping the sky from the magnetosphere to interplanetary space while exploring the dynamic polar regions in unprecedented detail. It is in these regions that the most important interactions between the magnetosphere and the solar wind take place. - Cluster's continuous observations, longevity, unique orbit, and changing configuration as a multi-spacecraft mission make it a key instrument in understanding the complex magnetic environment of the Earth and its finely balanced relationship with the Sun. In this article, we present some of the scientific highlights from this remarkable mission. Some of the scientific highlights from this remarkable mission are presented. 4) Models and maps of the Earth's magnetosphere: Among Cluster's most notable successes has been in its ability to model and map the Earth's magnetosphere, the region where the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field interact. The powerful magnetic field the Earth produces has the vital job of shielding the atmosphere and surface of the Earth from the Sun's perpetual bombardment of – at times – dangerous energetic particles, and yet how it behaves is still not well understood. The rise of space travel has made mapping this activity a much more important and pressing matter. The magnetosphere acts as a giant energy reservoir, absorbing energy from the solar wind and expelling it violently during magnetic storms. Predicting these outbursts is key to delivering space missions safely. In"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 28,"2014, a study using Cluster data revealed a new model of this mysterious region. The study brought together data from several spacecraft, as well as supporting observations from solar wind probes and ground-based geomagnetic observatories, to develop a model that describes the Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with the solar wind not just theoretically as had been the case previously, but based on actual measurements. Recently, the model has been refined and improved, resulting in even better insight into the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere close to Earth and in the more distant reaches of the magnetosphere. This kind of global, observation-based, model of the magnetosphere would not have been possible without Cluster's data, which covers much higher latitudes than other missions. Using Cluster data in another way researchers were also able to map the cold plasma, flowing out from the Earth's atmosphere, in three dimensions and more accurately than ever before, a development with particularly important implications for predicting space weather and the dynamics of the magnetosphere. Cold plasma is made up of slow moving, positively charged particles that are created when the Sun strips atmospheric atoms of their electrons leaving behind their positively charged nuclei. These are thought to play an important role in how the storms affect us. However, prior to the study in question the quantity of cold plasma around the Earth was unknown and very difficult to detect. Spacecraft – whose exterior will also be positively charged for the same reason as the cold plasma – repel the plasma,"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 29,"making it easy to miss. Using the unique configuration of the four Cluster spacecraft researchers analyzed anomalies in the data that resulted from the plasma particles being repelled by, and moving around, each spacecraft. The data showed that cold plasma dominates most of the volume of the magnetosphere at least 50-70% of the time, much more than previously thought, and reaches from the top of Earth's atmosphere to at least a quarter of the distance to the Moon. Taking this extra amount of cold plasma into account when creating models for space weather will much improve their accuracy and fill some of the missing gaps that currently exist in knowledge about how plasma might affect solar storms. 5) Mysteries of the magnetosphere: Mapping Earth's complex magnetosphere has also led to new insights about the dynamics of what is known at the magnetotail – the region of the magnetosphere that extends beyond the Earth, away from the Sun. The magnetotail consists of two lobes – northern and southern – containing very few particles and separated by a plasma sheet. This sheet has a much higher density of charged particles than the lobes and a magnetic field which, while weaker, varies hugely in amplitude. For a long time it has been theorized that these variations are caused by oscillations in the sheet's current but the origins of the oscillations were unknown. In 2004, data from Cluster revealed the origins of the oscillations for the first time and proved that they are not, like so much else in the"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 30,"magnetosphere, caused by external influence but by internal processes. The researchers found waves (dubbed kink-like waves) at the center of the tail with properties unlike any seen before. These waves are emitted and propagate outwards causing the oscillations observed. The mysterious oscillation of the magnetotail's plasma sheet is not the only mystery to be solved by Cluster. In 2015 an international team of scientists set out specifically to solve a fifty-year-old magnetosphere mystery. The mystery at hand was equatorial noise: noisy plasma waves located close to the equatorial plane of Earth's magnetic field. The waves were first observed in 1966 and have since become the most frequently observed waves by spacecraft in the region, yet no one had the evidence for a robust theory of their structure or where they came from – until 2015. When this evidence finally came, the equatorial noise turned out to be far from noisy. In fact, Cluster observations revealed a highly structured and periodic pattern, much more coherent and structured than most plasma waves. The well organized spectroscopic pattern matched the frequencies of protons moving in a circular motion in a uniform magnetic field and thus confirmed that the waves are generated by protons. To get this result required observations over distance and time that were only possible with Cluster's unique configuration and this gave the answers to a mystery that has eluded researchers for half a century. Cluster observes the structure of equatorial noise (14 July 2015, see Figure 35). 6) New view of the solar wind: Cluster not"

Key to this is the solar wind, a stream of electrically charged atomic particles, known as plasma, which is ejected by the Sun and travels across the Solar System, carrying its own magnetic field with it. The solar wind travels at speeds of up to 2000 km/hour and reaches temperatures of one million degrees Celsius. Cluster has been used to probe the detail of this wind, zooming in to reveal fine details in the plasma's dynamics and to make extremely detailed observations. One resulting discovery from this zooming in on the Sun's destructive wind is that there are swirls of turbulence within it, even on a very small scale. This turbulence arises from irregularities in the flow of particles and magnetic field lines (Figure 25). The turbulence was uncovered using just two of the four Cluster satellites and showed for the first time that the solar wind plasma is extremely structured at this high resolution with turbulent swirls bordered by a sheet of electric current just 20 km across. This small-scale phenomena has a big effect on how the plasma behaves and it is thought to be these cascades of energy that contribute to the overall heating of the solar wind.

Cluster has redefined how we think about the magnetosphere with the discovery that, when it comes to the solar wind, our trusted shield is more a sieve than a barrier and is penetrated in numerous places, and in numerous ways, by the solar wind's onslaught of charged particles. It has been known for some time that there are locations on the outer region of the magnetosphere, known as the magnetopause, where the solar wind particles are able to penetrate. This occurs at points where the Earth's magnetic field and the magnetic field of the Sun – the interplanetary magnetic field – are pointing in opposite directions; one to the south, the other to the north. At these points a process known as reconnection, where field lines break and reconnect to others around them, takes place, essentially creating a door in the magnetopause for the solar wind particles to enter through. This explains the presence of reservoirs of high-energy particles under these areas in the magnetopause but for some time scientists remained puzzled as to why these reservoirs are also found in areas where the two magnetic fields at the magnetopause are aligned and should therefore create an impenetrable barrier. It was in 2004 that Cluster solved this mystery when researchers discovered giant vortices of gas at the magnetopause boundary in areas where the Earth and interplanetary magnetic field lines were aligned. These huge swirls of"

This results in vortices of material up to 40 000 km across containing superheated material with the energy to drill through the magnetopause. Figure 26: 3D cut-away view of Earth's magnetosphere with Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices in Earth's magnetosphere (image credit: H. Hasegawa (Dartmouth College)) These finding have been further developed since, most notably in 2012 with the discovery of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves at other latitudes and orientations of the interplanetary magnetic field, and further analysis of the spatial structures and characteristics of them. Complementing these findings, Cluster scientists have gained startling new insights into reconnection, the more established process for penetration of the magnetosphere. In reconnection, two parallel field lines with fields pointing in opposite directions collide, snap, and reconnect to form an entirely new magnetic topography which, in the case of the magnetopause, creates an open door for the solar wind to penetrate. Despite being key to many theories and observations the heart of this physical process, the point where the magnetic field lines break and reform, had not been observed in situ until 2006. The restricting factor for making this observation was that you need at least four simultaneous observations in order to characterize it, a functionality that only Cluster could provide. Using Cluster, scientists have now successfully characterized this point, known as the magnetic null, in three dimensions and its physical properties and topology"

In 2017, scientists reported another surprising finding made with Cluster data: contrary to the consensus at the time, most of the energy dissipated during a reconnection event is not released at the crossings, or X-lines, between the two plasma flows but rather in swirling vortices, or O-lines, where magnetic field lines bundle up and spiral together. The finding is an important step in the process of understanding the mechanisms that accelerate particles in space plasma. Although there are several ways through the magnetopause and the potential damage of the solar wind is undeniable, some of the most dangerous particles in the magnetosphere don't come from outside but are formed from within. The aptly named highly energetic particles known as killer electrons, found in Earth's outer radiation belt, are some of the most disruptive in the magnetosphere and can cause havoc for satellites. Luckily, satellite orbits can be adjusted to avoid these belts, or their key technology can be shut down when they transit through, but during solar storms the number of killer electrons swells and they can relocate, potentially causing mayhem. In 2004 scientists finally disentangled what causes these killer electrons to occur when Cluster observed the process first hand. They found that first, a shock wave from a solar storm hits the Earth's magnetic field causing it to compress and accelerate electrons within the magnetosphere. Then, immediately afterwards, Earth's magnetic field lines vibrate at ultra-low frequencies to"

This discovery is key to improving the predictions about radiation in near-Earth space that keep satellites and astronauts safe. Cluster may have shown us the dangers within the magnetosphere, and that it is not quite as impenetrable as we once thought, but the shielding effect that our magnetic field affords us should not be undervalued. Indeed, in 2012 Cluster worked with Mars Express to compare the effects of the same gust of solar wind on the atmospheres of Mars and Earth and found that Earth's magnetic field is essential for keeping our atmosphere in place. Observing both planets during a chance alignment showed that Mars' atmosphere lost oxygen at a rate ten times that of Earth, a difference which, over time, could explain some of the differences in atmosphere between the two planets and why ours was able to foster life. 8) Understanding auroras: Knowledge about the relationship between the magnetosphere and the solar wind, and the mechanisms by which plasma travels across the magnetopause is key to understanding the processes behind space weather phenomena such as magnetic storms and auroras. Auroras are among the most famous features of our skies, and they are certainly a stunning visual display of the Sun's effect on Earth, but they are still not well understood. Cluster has, however, helped to shed light on some of their mysterious behaviors. Auroras are a consequence of the solar wind penetrating the magnetopause when magnetic reconnection occurs. These high-energy"

Viewers are most likely to catch this display at 65-70 degrees north or south of the equator, encircling the polar caps in a region known as the auroral oval. However, if the Sun's magnetic field arrives at Earth with a certain orientation aurora can occur at higher latitudes, and the origin of these auroras are much less understood. In 2014 Cluster worked with NASA's IMAGE satellite to explain the workings of very high latitude auroras known as ""theta auroras"". With the Cluster satellites located in the southern hemisphere magnetic lobe, and the IMAGE spacecraft having a wide-field view of the southern hemisphere, aurora researchers observed the phenomena more fully than ever before and could finally reveal its origin. They discovered that the lobe, an area of the magnetosphere which is usually filled with cold, unenergetic, plasma, does in some cases fill up with hot plasma when magnetic reconnection occurs on the night side of the Earth, thus closing the field lines and trapping the plasma within. Because the field lines are closed the solar wind can no longer enter and yet, as Cluster observed this strangely energetic plasma IMAGE simultaneously observed the theta aurora, proving the build-up of hot plasma to be the origin of these rare auroras. This is not the only aurora mystery that Cluster has unravelled. In 2015 Cluster revealed, for the first time, the relationship between the bright"

In 2001 Cluster made the first ever observations of the dark auroras and revealed that the electron population of the ionosphere – the ionized region of the atmosphere where the auroras occur – becomes depleted in these dark regions. These black auroras are not the result of particles entering our atmosphere down magnetic field lines and striking atoms, as is the case with colored auroras, but of particles escaping in the other direction, emptying the ionosphere as they go. Fourteen years later, in 2015, scientists were able to use Cluster to develop the first accurate model of the electric fields and currents within black auroras and to demonstrate the relationship between the currents that bring particles from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere – creating auroras – and those that suck the particles from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere – creating dark auroras. Understanding how the magnetosphere and ionosphere exchange particles is not just an exercise in satisfying curiosity. Changes in the number of electrons in the ionosphere can affect GPS signals reducing the accuracy of their navigation and timing, and have an impact on the radar and radio communications of aircraft flying over the North Pole. Understanding the ionosphere and being able to make predictions using models like those developed with Cluster is vital in our modern society. 9) Clues to a life-giving atmosphere: Cluster has shown that the Earth's magnetic field plays a vital role"

Until 2013 the flow of plasma from the plasmasphere to the outer magnetosphere had only been observed in short bursts, known as plumes, which, even combined with the biggest contributor of plasma to our magnetosphere – the solar wind – could not account for the replenishment of plasma predicted in models. It was the capabilities of Cluster that enabled scientists to resolve this issue. Cluster data were used to identify a leakage of material from the plasmasphere outwards – a leak that constantly transfers material to the magnetosphere. Rather than looking just at plumes of material, there is now evidence of a steady wind of plasma from plasmasphere to magnetosphere, transferring almost 90 tonnes of plasma each day. This research was further built upon in 2016 using Cluster data to compare the steady leakage of Earth's atmosphere with the sporadic plumes that emanate from the plasmasphere (see Figure 31). Understanding the behavior of our atmosphere is key to untangling the conditions for life. We know that planetary atmospheres play an essential role in rendering a planet habitable or lifeless and to find the potential for life in atmospheres elsewhere, we first need to understand our own (Ref 17). • January 29, 2018: For the first time, scientists have estimated how much energy is transferred from"

Our planet and a few others stand out in this all-pervasive stream of particles: these are the planets that have a magnetic field of their own, and so represent an obstacle to the sweeping power of the solar wind. - It is the interaction between Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind that creates the intricate structure of the magnetosphere, a protective bubble that shields our planet from the vast majority of solar wind particles. - So far, scientists have achieved a fairly good understanding of the physical processes that take place in the solar wind plasma and in the magnetosphere.

Lina is the lead author of a new study that quantifies, for the first time, the role of turbulence in the magnetosheath. The results are published in Physical Review Letters. 19) - ""In the solar wind, we know that turbulence contributes to the dissipation of energy from large scales of hundreds of thousands of kilometers to smaller scales of a kilometer, where plasma particles are heated up and accelerated to higher energies,"" explains co-author Fouad Sahraoui from the Laboratory of Plasma Physics in France. - ""We suspected that a similar mechanism must be at play in the magnetosheath too, but we could never test it until now,"" he adds. - The magnetosheath plasma is more turbulent, home to a greater extent of density fluctuations and can be compressed to a much higher degree than the solar wind. As such, it is substantially more complex, and scientists have only in recent years developed the theoretical framework to study the physical processes taking place in such an environment. - Lina, Fouad and their collaborators combed through a vast volume of data collected between 2007 and 2011 by the four spacecraft of ESA's Cluster and two of the five spacecraft of NASA's THEMIS missions, which fly in formation through Earth's magnetic environment. - When they applied the recently developed theoretical tools to their data sample, they were in for"

Named after Austrian physicist Ernst Mach, it quantifies the speed of fluctuations in a flow with respect to the speed of sound in that fluid, indicating whether a flow is subsonic or supersonic. - While the energy transfer rate is tricky to determine unless using space probes that take in situ measurements, like the Cluster spacecraft sampling the plasma around Earth, the Mach number can be more easily estimated using remote observations of a variety of astrophysical plasma beyond the realm of our planet. - ""If this empirical relation turns out to be universal, it will be extremely useful to explore cosmic plasma that cannot be directly probed with spacecraft, such as the interstellar"

Scientists have suggested that the cause of this heating may be hidden in the turbulent character of the solar wind plasma. - Advanced supercomputer simulations are helping to understand these complex motions: the image shown in Figure 29 is from one such simulation. It represents the distribution of the current density in the turbulent solar wind plasma, where localized filaments and vortices have appeared as a consequence of the turbulent energy cascade.

Moreover, between the islands, the current becomes very intense, creating high magnetic stress regions and sometimes a phenomenon known as magnetic reconnection. That is, when magnetic field lines of opposite direction get close together they can suddenly realign into new configurations, releasing vast amounts of energy that can cause localized heating. - Such events are observed in space, for example by ESA's Cluster quartet of satellites in Earth orbit, in the solar wind.

All the necessary commanding is mostly performed automatically under direct supervision of spacecraft controllers and operations engineers. - The whole sequence takes, currently, just over two hours with the spacecraft being configured in parallel using two ground station antennas.

According to a new study, most of the energy dissipated during a reconnection event is not released at the crossings, or X-lines, between the two plasma flows but rather in swirling vortices, or O-lines, where magnetic field lines bundle up and spiral together. The new finding, which contradicts the accepted consensus, is an important step in the process of understanding the mechanisms that accelerate particles in space plasma. 22) Figure 30: X- and O-lines during magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetosphere.

The mixture of charged particles – electrons, protons, and heavier ions – is found in the atmosphere of the Sun, in the magnetic environment of Earth, and in the vastness of interplanetary and interstellar space. - An important phenomenon occurring in plasma is magnetic reconnection, which happens when the magnetic field lines of two colliding flows of plasma are broken and reconfigure immediately afterwards in a different geometry. In the process, the energy"

As a result, plasma particles are accelerated and can infiltrate the upper layer of Earth's atmosphere – the ionosphere – causing the beautiful polar lights, as well as disruptive magnetic storms that can interfere with satellites and telecommunication networks. - Scientists study magnetic reconnection using space missions like ESA's Cluster, which consists of four spacecraft flying in formation through the Earth's magnetic environment, as well as laboratory experiments and computer simulations. - Bridging the microscopic and macroscopic aspects of magnetic reconnection, from the particle level to the large-scale flows of matter and energy, is one of the major unsolved questions concerning this ubiquitous process. In particular, scientists are striving to understand how energy is dissipated when the magnetic field lines break, eventually leading to the acceleration of particles. - One aspect that seemed well established – the identification of the sites where energy dissipation takes place – is now being shaken up by a new study based on data from Cluster. These results call for a rethink of the standard view of magnetic reconnection. - Under scrutiny are the two"

The main X-line is located at the crossing of the two flows, whereas smaller X-lines as well as O-lines – whirlpool-shaped vortices where the magnetic field lines swirl together – may appear throughout the broader diffusion region. - ""We always thought that, in a magnetic reconnection event, energy would be dissipated at the X-lines, but the new evidence shows we've been looking at the wrong place,"" says Huishan Fu of Beihang University, China, lead author of the study published in Geophysical Research Letters. - ""In fact, most of the energy is being dissipated at the O-lines instead."" 23) - Previous studies based on observations of magnetic reconnection events suggested that energy must be dissipated at the X-lines, which are the sites from which the two jets of high-speed particles are launched. However, these analyses did not include an accurate estimate of the location of X- and O-lines, as there was no method at that time to infer the magnetic field line geometry throughout the diffusion region. - The new study is the first to apply a recently developed method to reconstruct such topology, and it was this that enabled the scientists to reliably identify the sites of the X- and O-lines in the plasma. - The method, developed by Huishan and collaborators and published in 2015, was tested on data from Cluster and NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS), which also consists of four spacecraft, as well as on the output"

It provides the mathematical formalism not only to reconstruct the geometrical configuration of the magnetic field in the space between the four spacecraft that took the measurements, but also to expand the reconstruction to a broader region surrounding the spacecraft. - The team applied this method to a magnetic reconnection event recorded by Cluster on 9 October 2003, when the spacecraft passed through a reconnection diffusion region, moving on the night side of Earth, in the magnetotail of our planet. This was a rare and valuable event because the four spacecraft were flying through the diffusion region, only about 200 km apart, where they encountered several potential sites of X- and O-lines. - ""With our method, we could reconstruct the topology of the plasma that the four Cluster spacecraft had flown through,"" explains Huishan. ""We were extremely surprised to see that the electric current was very weak at X-lines, while it was very strong at the O-lines. This means that, contrary to our expectations, the O-lines are where most of the energy is dissipated."" - The new finding, which is in stark contradiction to the present-day consensus, suggests that something profound is missing from the current understanding of magnetic reconnection. - The strong energy dissipation at O-lines is likely due to the current-driven turbulence, which is also very intense at the O-lines as revealed by Cluster.

However, understanding Earth's atmosphere, and how it escapes to space, is key to understanding the atmospheres of other planets, and could be crucial in our hunt for habitable planets and extraterrestrial life. - We have been exploring Earth's magnetic environment for years using satellites such as ESA's Cluster mission, a fleet of four spacecraft launched in 2000. Cluster has been continuously observing the magnetic interactions between the Sun and Earth for over a decade and half; this longevity, combined with its multi-spacecraft capabilities and unique orbit, have made it a key player in understanding both Earth's leaking atmosphere and how our planet interacts with the surrounding Solar System. - Earth's magnetic field is complex; it extends from the interior of our planet out into space, exerting its influence over a region of space dubbed the magnetosphere. - The magnetosphere – and its inner region (the plasmasphere), a doughnut-shaped portion sitting atop our atmosphere, which co-rotates with Earth and extends to an average distance of 20,000 km – is flooded with charged particles and ions that are trapped, bouncing back and forth along field lines (Figures 31 and 32). - At its outer Sunward edge the magnetosphere meets the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles – mostly protons and electrons – flowing from the Sun.

Just as particles can head inwards down these open polar lines, particles can also head outwards. Ions from Earth's upper atmosphere – the ionosphere, which extends to roughly 1000 km above the Earth – also flood out to fill up this region of space. Although missions such as Cluster have discovered much, the processes involved remain unclear. ""The question of plasma transport and atmospheric loss is relevant for both planets and stars, and is an incredibly fascinating and important topic. Understanding how atmospheric matter escapes is crucial to understanding how life can develop on a planet,"" said Arnaud Masson, ESA's Deputy Project Scientist for the Cluster mission. ""The interaction between incoming and outgoing material in Earth's magnetosphere is a hot topic at the moment; where exactly is this stuff coming from? How did it enter our patch of space?"" Initially, scientists believed Earth's magnetic environment to be filled purely with particles of solar origin. However, as early as the 1990s it was predicted that Earth's atmosphere was leaking out into the plasmasphere – something that has since turned out to be true. Observations have shown sporadic, powerful columns of plasma, dubbed plumes, growing within the plasmasphere, travelling outwards to the edge of the magnetosphere and interacting with solar wind plasma entering the magnetosphere. More recent studies have unambiguously confirmed another source – Earth's atmosphere is constantly leaking! Alongside the aforementioned plumes, a steady, continuous flow of material (comprising oxygen, hydrogen, and"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 53,"helium ions) leaves our planet's plasmasphere from the polar regions, replenishing the plasma within the magnetosphere. Cluster found proof of this wind, and has quantified its strength for both overall (reported in a paper published in 2013) and for hydrogen ions in particular (reported in 2009). Overall, about 1 kg of material is escaping our atmosphere every second, amounting to almost 90 tons per day. Singling out just cold ions (light hydrogen ions, which require less energy to escape and thus possess a lower energy in the magnetosphere), the escape mass totals thousands of tons per year. Cold ions are important; many satellites – Cluster excluded – cannot detect them due to their low energies, but they form a significant part of the net matter loss from Earth, and may play a key role in shaping our magnetic environment. Solar storms and periods of heightened solar activity appear to speed up Earth's atmospheric loss significantly, by more than a factor of three. However, key questions remain: How do ions escape, and where do they originate? What processes are at play, and which is dominant? Where do the ions go? And how? One of the key escape processes is thought to be centrifugal acceleration, which speeds up ions at Earth's poles as they cross the shape-shifting magnetic field lines there. These ions are shunted onto different drift trajectories, gain energy, and end up heading away from Earth into the magnetotail, where they interact with plasma and return to Earth at far higher speeds than they departed with"

Such high-energy particles can pose a threat to space-based technology, so understanding them is important. Cluster has explored this process multiple times during the past decade and a half – finding it to affect heavier ions such as oxygen more than lighter ones, and also detecting strong, high-speed beams of ions rocketing back to Earth from the magnetotail nearly 100 times over the course of three years. More recently, scientists have explored the process of magnetic reconnection, one of the most efficient physical processes by which the solar wind enters Earth's magnetosphere and accelerates plasma. In this process, plasma interacts and exchanges energy with magnetic field lines; different lines reconfigure themselves, breaking, shifting around, and forging new connections by merging with other lines, releasing huge amounts of energy in the process. Figure 33: Magnetic reconnection in the tail of Earth's magnetosphere (image credit: ESA/ATG medialab) Here, the cold ions are thought to be important. We know that cold ions affect the magnetic reconnection process, for example slowing down the reconnection rate at the boundary where the solar wind meets the magnetosphere (the magnetopause), but we are still unsure of the mechanisms at play. ""In essence, we need to figure out how cold plasma ends up at the magnetopause,"" said Philippe Escoubet, ESA's Project Scientist for the Cluster mission.

Recently, scientists modelled and simulated Earth's magnetic environment with a focus on structures known as plasmoids and flux ropes – cylinders, tubes, and loops of plasma that become tangled up with magnetic field lines. These arise when the magnetic reconnection process occurs in the magnetotail and ejects plasmoids both towards the outer tail and towards Earth. Cold ions may play a significant role in deciding the direction of the ejected plasmoid. These recent simulations showed a link between plasmoids heading towards Earth and heavy oxygen ions leaking out from the ionosphere – in other words, oxygen ions may reduce and quench the reconnection rates at certain points within the magnetotail that produce tailward trajectories, thus making it more favorable at other sites that instead send them Earthwards. These results agree with existing Cluster observations (Ref. 25). • As of January 2016, the Cluster-II mission is more than 15 years on orbit operating nominally. • July 2015: For the first time two ESA space missions, Cluster and Swarm, joined forces to simultaneously measure the properties of Earth's magnetic field at two different altitudes.

Their intensity is highly variable, much more intense during magnetic substorms when colorful auroras light up the sky. What this joint activity delivers is the ability to characterize FACs in the ionosphere and magnetosphere at the same time – particularly their intensity. 26) 27) - The three satellites of ESA's Swarm mission have the main goal of probing the strength, properties and dynamics of Earth's internal magnetic field. However the satellites' precision sensors also pick up the natural and powerful electric currents flowing through the ionosphere and magnetosphere, but these are normally considered as a noise source in Swarm measurements, with Cluster helping to disentangle them. On the other hand, enhanced understanding and eventually predicting of strong currents in the ionosphere is important because they can disrupt power grids and pipelines via induced electrical components, even triggering component burnout in transformers and other electrical devices. - Cluster and Swarm began joining up to better understand FACs and other complex magnetic behavior around Earth in spring 2014. They will continue working together into the future, with more joint campaigns planned until 2018.

Very narrow-banded emissions at frequencies corresponding to exact multiples of the proton gyrofrequency (frequency of gyration around the field line) from the 17th up to the 30th harmonic were observed, indicating that these waves are generated by the proton distributions. 28) 29) - Back in 1966, the NASA satellite OGO-3 (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-3) discovered 'noisy' plasma waves at an altitude of around 18 000 km above the Earth. The waves occurred very close to the equatorial plane of the planet's magnetic field – the geomagnetic equator. 30) - The location of the electric and magnetic fields of these waves, together with their unstructured nature, led to them being termed 'equatorial noise'. This 'noise' turned out to be one of the most frequently observed emissions in near-Earth space, being detected by many spacecraft as they fly over the geomagnetic equator. - Observations over the years by various space missions showed some evidence for discrete frequency bands, suggesting that the waves may interact with protons, alpha particles, and electrons near the geomagnetic equator. However, the width and spacing of these frequency bands appeared to be non-uniform and could not be accurately measured, except at low frequency. - Although several theories were proposed to explain how these waves were generated, their value was limited by a lack of clear observational evidence that could be used to support modelling of the phenomenon, and by the limited accuracy"

The periodic pattern of emissions observed on Cluster 4 was almost an exact replication of that observed by Cluster 3, showing that the highly organized, periodic wave structure measured at least 60 km across. - The spectral observations, together with observations of particle distributions, allowed the researchers to calculate the growth rates of the waves. The Cluster spacecraft measurements also enabled them to determine the polarization properties of the waves, further confirming that the observed emissions were the same type as those usually observed in equatorial noise waves. - This study clearly showed that these waves were produced by so-called ion ring distributions. This arrangement refers to the ring-like velocity distributions of the charged particles close to the geomagnetic equator, where more particles are observed at high velocity than low velocity.

The illustration on the right depicts the bow shock around Earth, our planet's shield against cosmic radiation and a giant particle accelerator that transfers and redistributes energy throughout space. Shocks are known to be very efficient particle accelerators, and potentially responsible for creating some of the most energetic particles in the Universe. Using data from ESA's Cluster mission, scientists have revealed the mechanisms at play when this shock transfers energy from one type to another, finding direct evidence of small-scale structures within Earth's magnetic field that are key in helping waves of plasma to 'break'. - The new study used observations from two of the Cluster mission's four spacecraft, which flew in tight formation through Earth's bow shock, sitting just 7 kilometers apart. - The data were gathered on 24 January 2015 at a distance of 90,000 km from Earth, roughly a quarter of the way to the Moon, and reveal properties of the bow shock that were previously unclear due to the lack of such closely spaced in-situ measurements. - When a supersonic flow encounters an obstacle, a shock forms. This is seen often in the Universe around stars, supernova remnants, comets, and planets – including our own.

""Thanks to missions like Cluster, we are able to place multiple spacecraft within and around it, covering scales from hundreds to only a few kilometers.

The inset in the upper left shows an artist's impression of the four Cluster spacecraft, as two of them (Cluster 3 and Cluster 4) took measurements within a particularly thin and variable part of the shock known as the shock ramp on 24 January 2015. The two spacecraft were sitting just 7 km apart, taking in-situ measurements at a never-before-achieved close separation. The graph to the lower left relays the two sets of measurements of the magnetic field – one plotted in red (Cluster 3) and one in white (Cluster 4). Differences in the measured field provide evidence that small-scale magnetic field structures exist within the broader extent of the bow shock. These small structures are key in facilitating the breaking of plasma waves within the shock, and thus the transfer of energy, in this portion of Earth's magnetic environment. - There are several types of shock, defined by the ways in which they transfer kinetic energy into other kinds of energy. In Earth's atmosphere, kinetic energy is transformed into heat as particles collide with one another – but the vast distances at play at our planet's bow shock mean that particle collisions cannot play such a role in energy transfer there, as they are simply too far apart. - This type of shock is thus known as a collisionless shock. Such shocks can exist across a vast range of scales, from millimeters up to"

In a way, it behaves like a wave in the sea: as a wave approaches the beach, it seems to grow in size as the depth decreases, until it breaks – this is because the crest of the wave moves faster than the trough, causing it to fold over and break. This kind of 'breaking' occurs for waves of plasma, too, although the physics is somewhat more complicated."" - To investigate in detail the physical scales at which this wave breaking is initiated – something which was previously unknown – the researchers solicited a special campaign in which two of the four Cluster probes were moved to an unprecedentedly close separation of less than 7 km, gathering high-resolution data from within the shock itself. - Analyzing the data, the team found that the measurements of the magnetic field obtained by the two Cluster spacecraft differed significantly. This direct evidence that small-scale magnetic field structures exist within the broader extent of the bow shock indicate that they are key in facilitating the breaking of plasma waves, and thus the transfer of energy, in this portion of the magnetosphere. - With sizes of a few kilometers, similar to the scales at which electrons rotate around the magnetic field lines, these structures are located in a"

""By achieving incredibly small spacecraft separations – seven kilometers as used in this study and even smaller, down to just three kilometers – Cluster is allowing us to probe our planet's magnetic environment at the smallest scales ever achieved. This advances our understanding of Earth's bow shock and how it acts as a giant particle accelerator – something that is key in our knowledge of the high-energy Universe."" • November 14, 2018: The SPC (Science Program Committee) of ESA has confirmed the continued operations of ten scientific missions in the Agency's fleet up to 2022. After a comprehensive review of their scientific merits and technical status, the SPC has decided to extend the operation of the five missions led by ESA's Science Program: Cluster, Gaia, INTEGRAL, Mars Express,"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 70,"and XMM-Newton. The SPC also confirmed the Agency's contributions to the extended operations of Hinode, Hubble, IRIS, SOHO, and ExoMars TGO. - This includes the confirmation of operations for the 2019–2020 cycle for missions that had been given indicative extensions as part of the previous extension process, and indicative extensions for an additional two years, up to 2022. Note: Every two years, all missions whose approved operations end within the following four years are subject to review by the advisory structure of the Science Directorate. Extensions are granted to missions that satisfy the established criteria for operational status and science return, subject to the level of financial resources available in the science program. These extensions are valid for the following four years, subject to a mid-term review and confirmation after two years. - The decision was taken during the SPC meeting at ESA/ESAC (European Space Astronomy Center) near Madrid, Spain, on 14 November. - ESA's science missions have unique capabilities and are prolific in their scientific output. Cluster, for example, is the only mission that, by varying the separation between its four spacecraft, allows multipoint measurements of the magnetosphere in different regions and at different scales, while Gaia is performing the most precise astrometric survey ever realized, enabling unprecedented studies of the distribution and motions of stars in the Milky Way and beyond. - Many of the science missions are proving to be of great value to pursue investigations that were not foreseen at the time of their launch. Examples include the role of INTEGRAL and"

The interplay between solar missions like Hinode, IRIS and SOHO provides an extensive suite of complementary instruments to study our Sun; meanwhile, Mars Express and ExoMars TGO are at the forefront of the international fleet investigating the Red Planet. - Another compelling factor to support the extension is the introduction of new modes of operation to accommodate the evolving needs of the scientific community, as well as new opportunities for scientists to get involved with the missions. • November 8, 2018: Space weather is no abstract concept – it may happen in space, but its effects on Earth can be significant. To help better forecast these effects, ESA's Cluster mission, a quartet of spacecraft that was launched in 2000, is currently working to understand how our planet is connected to its magnetic environment, and unravelling the complex relationship between the Earth and its parent star. - Despite appearances, the space surrounding our planet is far from empty. The Earth is surrounded by various layers of atmosphere, is constantly bathed in a flow of charged particles streaming out from the Sun, known as the solar wind, and sends its own magnetic field lines out into the cosmos. - This field floods our immediate patch of space, acting as a kind of shield against any extreme"

It also defines our planet's magnetosphere, a region of space dominated by Earth's magnetic field and filled with energy that is topped up by the solar wind and sporadically released into the near-Earth environment. - With this comes ‘weather'. We occasionally experience magnetic storms and events that disturb and interact with Earth's radiation belts, atmosphere, and planetary surface. One of the most famous examples of this is the auroras that Earth experiences at its poles. These shimmering sheets of color form as the solar wind disrupts and breaches the upper layers of our atmosphere. - Space Weather has a real impact on our activities on Earth, and poses a significant risk to spacefarers – robotic and human alike. - Sudden flurries of high-energy particles emanating from the Sun can contain up to 100 million tons of material; this can penetrate spacecraft walls or affect their electronics, disable satellites, and take down terrestrial electrical transformers and power grids. There are currently about 1800 active satellites circling our planet, and our dependence on space technology is only growing stronger. - ""This highlights a pressing need for more accurate space weather forecasts,"" says Philippe Escoubet, Project Scientist for ESA's Cluster mission. ""To understand and predict this weather, we need to know more about how the Earth and the Sun are connected, and what the magnetic environment around the Earth looks and acts like. This is what Cluster is helping us to do."" - Various spacecraft are investigating the magnetic environment"

Efforts have been internationally collaborative, from observatories including ESA's Cluster and Swarm missions, NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale mission (MMS), the Van Allen Probes, and THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms), and the Japanese (JAXA/ISAS) Arase and Geotail missions. - Cluster comprises four identical spacecraft that fly in a pyramid-like formation, and is able to gather incredibly detailed data on the complex structure and fluctuations of our magnetic environment. - For nearly two decades, this quartet has mapped our magnetosphere and pinpointed flows of cold plasma and interactions with the solar wind, probed our magnetotail – an extension of the magnetosphere that stretches beyond the Earth in the direction opposite to the Sun. The mission also modelled the small-scale turbulence and intricate dynamics of the solar wind itself, and helped to explain the mysteries of Earth's auroras. - While this back catalog of discoveries is impressive enough, Cluster is still producing new insights, especially in the realm of space weather. Recently, the mission has been instrumental in building more accurate models of our planet's magnetic field both close to Earth (at so-called geosynchronous altitudes) and at large distances from Earth's surface – no mean feat. - In addition, ESA's Swarm mission is also providing insight into our planet's magnetic field. Launched in 2013 and comprising three identical satellites, Swarm has been measuring precisely the magnetic signals that stem from Earth's core, mantle, crust and oceans, as well as from the ionosphere and magnetosphere."

""Unexpected or extreme outbursts of space weather can badly damage any satellites we have in orbit around the Earth, so being able to keep better track of them – while simultaneously gaining a better understanding of our planet's dynamic magnetic field structure – is key to their safety."" - Cluster also recently tracked the impact of huge outbursts of highly energetic particles and photons from the outer layers of the Sun known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The data showed that CMEs are able to trigger both strong and weak geomagnetic storms as they meet and are deformed at Earth's bow shock– the boundary where the solar wind meets the outer limits of our magnetosphere. - Such storms are extreme events. Cluster explored a specific storm that occurred in September 2017, triggered by two consecutive CMEs separated by 24 hours. It studied how the storm affected the flow of charged particles leaving the polar regions of the ionosphere, a layer of Earth's upper atmosphere, above around 100 km, and found this flow to have increased around the polar cap by more than 30 times. This enhanced flow has consequences for space weather, such as increased drag for satellites, and is thought to be a result of the ionosphere being heated by multiple intense solar flares. - The mission has observed how various other phenomena affect our magnetosphere, too. It spotted tiny, hot, local anomalies in the flow of solar wind that caused the entire magnetosphere to vibrate,"

These observations connect data gathered near Earth to those obtained by Sun-watching satellites some 1.5 million km away at a location known as Lagrangian Point 1 – such as the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). These data offer all-important evidence for solar wind dynamics in this complex and unclear region of space. - ""All of this, and more, has really made it possible to better understand the dynamics of Earth's magnetic field, and how it relates to the space weather we see,"" says Escoubet. ""Cluster has produced such wonderful science in the past 18 years – but there's still so much more to come."" • February 8, 2018: As inhabitants of the third rock from the Sun, we have a vested interest in understanding our home planet and its environment. Among the flotilla of spacecraft that have been sent to investigate Earth from space are the four spacecraft of the Cluster mission. Since 2000, they have been tirelessly gathering vital data about the magnetic environment around our planet and, in the process, about one of the most important relationships in the Solar System: the physical connection between the Earth and the Sun. - Cluster was the first mission to study the magnetosphere (the region where"

To better understand this region is to better understand how life was and is possible on our planet. Cluster data also provide essential insights for safe air travel, space travel and effective satellite communications. - Most missions studying the magnetosphere focus their efforts around the equator where much of the electric currents flow. The Cluster fleet, however, occupies a polar orbit, sweeping the sky from the magnetosphere to interplanetary space while exploring the dynamic polar regions in unprecedented detail. It is in these regions that the most important interactions between the magnetosphere and the solar wind take place. - Cluster's continuous observations, longevity, unique orbit, and changing configuration as a multi-spacecraft mission make it a key instrument in understanding the complex magnetic environment of the Earth and its finely balanced relationship with the Sun. In this article, we present some of the scientific highlights from this remarkable mission. Some of the scientific highlights from this remarkable mission are presented. 4) Models and maps of the Earth's magnetosphere: Among Cluster's most notable successes has been in its ability to model and map the Earth's magnetosphere, the region where the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 77,"interact. The powerful magnetic field the Earth produces has the vital job of shielding the atmosphere and surface of the Earth from the Sun's perpetual bombardment of – at times – dangerous energetic particles, and yet how it behaves is still not well understood. The rise of space travel has made mapping this activity a much more important and pressing matter. The magnetosphere acts as a giant energy reservoir, absorbing energy from the solar wind and expelling it violently during magnetic storms. Predicting these outbursts is key to delivering space missions safely. In 2014, a study using Cluster data revealed a new model of this mysterious region. The study brought together data from several spacecraft, as well as supporting observations from solar wind probes and ground-based geomagnetic observatories, to develop a model that describes the Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with the solar wind not just theoretically as had been the case previously, but based on actual measurements. Recently, the model has been refined and improved, resulting in even better insight into the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere close to Earth and in the more distant reaches of the magnetosphere. This kind of global, observation-based, model of the magnetosphere would not have been possible without Cluster's data, which covers much higher latitudes than other missions. Using Cluster data in another way researchers were also able to map the cold plasma, flowing out from the Earth's atmosphere, in three dimensions and more accurately than ever before, a development with particularly important implications for predicting space"

Cold plasma is made up of slow moving, positively charged particles that are created when the Sun strips atmospheric atoms of their electrons leaving behind their positively charged nuclei. These are thought to play an important role in how the storms affect us. However, prior to the study in question the quantity of cold plasma around the Earth was unknown and very difficult to detect. Spacecraft – whose exterior will also be positively charged for the same reason as the cold plasma – repel the plasma, making it easy to miss. Using the unique configuration of the four Cluster spacecraft researchers analyzed anomalies in the data that resulted from the plasma particles being repelled by, and moving around, each spacecraft. The data showed that cold plasma dominates most of the volume of the magnetosphere at least 50-70% of the time, much more than previously thought, and reaches from the top of Earth's atmosphere to at least a quarter of the distance to the Moon. Taking this extra amount of cold plasma into account when creating models for space weather will much improve their accuracy and fill some of the missing gaps that currently exist in knowledge about how plasma might affect solar storms. 5) Mysteries of the magnetosphere: Mapping Earth's complex magnetosphere has also led to new insights about the dynamics of what is known at the magnetotail – the region of the magnetosphere that extends beyond the Earth, away from the Sun. The magnetotail consists of two lobes"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 79,"– northern and southern – containing very few particles and separated by a plasma sheet. This sheet has a much higher density of charged particles than the lobes and a magnetic field which, while weaker, varies hugely in amplitude. For a long time it has been theorized that these variations are caused by oscillations in the sheet's current but the origins of the oscillations were unknown. In 2004, data from Cluster revealed the origins of the oscillations for the first time and proved that they are not, like so much else in the magnetosphere, caused by external influence but by internal processes. The researchers found waves (dubbed kink-like waves) at the center of the tail with properties unlike any seen before. These waves are emitted and propagate outwards causing the oscillations observed. The mysterious oscillation of the magnetotail's plasma sheet is not the only mystery to be solved by Cluster. In 2015 an international team of scientists set out specifically to solve a fifty-year-old magnetosphere mystery. The mystery at hand was equatorial noise: noisy plasma waves located close to the equatorial plane of Earth's magnetic field. The waves were first observed in 1966 and have since become the most frequently observed waves by spacecraft in the region, yet no one had the evidence for a robust theory of their structure or where they came from – until 2015. When this evidence finally came, the equatorial noise turned out to be far from noisy. In fact, Cluster observations revealed a highly structured and periodic pattern, much more"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 80,"coherent and structured than most plasma waves. The well organized spectroscopic pattern matched the frequencies of protons moving in a circular motion in a uniform magnetic field and thus confirmed that the waves are generated by protons. To get this result required observations over distance and time that were only possible with Cluster's unique configuration and this gave the answers to a mystery that has eluded researchers for half a century. Cluster observes the structure of equatorial noise (14 July 2015, see Figure 35). 6) New view of the solar wind: Cluster not only turns its attention to the Earth's magnetosphere, but also to the external factors that shape it. Key to this is the solar wind, a stream of electrically charged atomic particles, known as plasma, which is ejected by the Sun and travels across the Solar System, carrying its own magnetic field with it. The solar wind travels at speeds of up to 2000 km/hour and reaches temperatures of one million degrees Celsius. Cluster has been used to probe the detail of this wind, zooming in to reveal fine details in the plasma's dynamics and to make extremely detailed observations. One resulting discovery from this zooming in on the Sun's destructive wind is that there are swirls of turbulence within it, even on a very small scale. This turbulence arises from irregularities in the flow of particles and magnetic field lines (Figure 25). The turbulence was uncovered using just two of the four Cluster satellites and showed for the first time that the solar"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 81,"wind plasma is extremely structured at this high resolution with turbulent swirls bordered by a sheet of electric current just 20 km across. This small-scale phenomena has a big effect on how the plasma behaves and it is thought to be these cascades of energy that contribute to the overall heating of the solar wind. 7) More a sieve than a barrier: New insights into the magnetosphere and the solar wind are a key output of the Cluster mission, but it is in studying the interactions between the two that the mission really makes it mark. Cluster has redefined how we think about the magnetosphere with the discovery that, when it comes to the solar wind, our trusted shield is more a sieve than a barrier and is penetrated in numerous places, and in numerous ways, by the solar wind's onslaught of charged particles. It has been known for some time that there are locations on the outer region of the magnetosphere, known as the magnetopause, where the solar wind particles are able to penetrate. This occurs at points where the Earth's magnetic field and the magnetic field of the Sun – the interplanetary magnetic field – are pointing in opposite directions; one to the south, the other to the north. At these points a process known as reconnection, where field lines break and reconnect to others around them, takes place, essentially creating a door in the magnetopause for the solar wind particles to enter through. This explains the presence of reservoirs of high-energy particles under"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 82,"these areas in the magnetopause but for some time scientists remained puzzled as to why these reservoirs are also found in areas where the two magnetic fields at the magnetopause are aligned and should therefore create an impenetrable barrier. It was in 2004 that Cluster solved this mystery when researchers discovered giant vortices of gas at the magnetopause boundary in areas where the Earth and interplanetary magnetic field lines were aligned. These huge swirls of plasma are formed by what are known as Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, which occur when two flows of material are aligned but travelling at different speeds causing them to slip past one another. This results in vortices of material up to 40 000 km across containing superheated material with the energy to drill through the magnetopause. These finding have been further developed since, most notably in 2012 with the discovery of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves at other latitudes and orientations of the interplanetary magnetic field, and further analysis of the spatial structures and characteristics of them. Complementing these findings, Cluster scientists have gained startling new insights into reconnection, the more established process for penetration of the magnetosphere. In reconnection, two parallel field lines with fields pointing in opposite directions collide, snap, and reconnect to form an entirely new magnetic topography which, in the case of the magnetopause, creates an open door for the solar wind to penetrate. Despite being key to many theories and observations the heart of this physical process, the point where the magnetic field lines break and reform, had not been observed"

The restricting factor for making this observation was that you need at least four simultaneous observations in order to characterize it, a functionality that only Cluster could provide. Using Cluster, scientists have now successfully characterized this point, known as the magnetic null, in three dimensions and its physical properties and topology have been described for the first time – in this case with a spatial extent of 500 km. In 2017, scientists reported another surprising finding made with Cluster data: contrary to the consensus at the time, most of the energy dissipated during a reconnection event is not released at the crossings, or X-lines, between the two plasma flows but rather in swirling vortices, or O-lines, where magnetic field lines bundle up and spiral together. The finding is an important step in the process of understanding the mechanisms that accelerate particles in space plasma. Although there are several ways through the magnetopause and the potential damage of the solar wind is undeniable, some of the most dangerous particles in the magnetosphere don't come from outside but are formed from within. The aptly named highly energetic particles known as killer electrons, found in Earth's outer radiation belt, are some of the most disruptive in the magnetosphere and can cause havoc for satellites. Luckily, satellite orbits can be adjusted to avoid these belts, or their key technology can be shut down when they transit through, but during solar storms the number of killer electrons swells and they can relocate, potentially causing mayhem. In 2004"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 84,"scientists finally disentangled what causes these killer electrons to occur when Cluster observed the process first hand. They found that first, a shock wave from a solar storm hits the Earth's magnetic field causing it to compress and accelerate electrons within the magnetosphere. Then, immediately afterwards, Earth's magnetic field lines vibrate at ultra-low frequencies to further accelerate the electrons – and all that can happen in just 15 minutes. This discovery is key to improving the predictions about radiation in near-Earth space that keep satellites and astronauts safe. Cluster may have shown us the dangers within the magnetosphere, and that it is not quite as impenetrable as we once thought, but the shielding effect that our magnetic field affords us should not be undervalued. Indeed, in 2012 Cluster worked with Mars Express to compare the effects of the same gust of solar wind on the atmospheres of Mars and Earth and found that Earth's magnetic field is essential for keeping our atmosphere in place. Observing both planets during a chance alignment showed that Mars' atmosphere lost oxygen at a rate ten times that of Earth, a difference which, over time, could explain some of the differences in atmosphere between the two planets and why ours was able to foster life. 8) Understanding auroras: Knowledge about the relationship between the magnetosphere and the solar wind, and the mechanisms by which plasma travels across the magnetopause is key to understanding the processes behind space weather phenomena such as magnetic storms and auroras. Auroras are among the most famous"

Cluster has, however, helped to shed light on some of their mysterious behaviors. Auroras are a consequence of the solar wind penetrating the magnetopause when magnetic reconnection occurs. These high-energy particles then travel along Earth's magnetic field lines and strike atoms high in the atmosphere creating the light displays we see from the surface. Viewers are most likely to catch this display at 65-70 degrees north or south of the equator, encircling the polar caps in a region known as the auroral oval. However, if the Sun's magnetic field arrives at Earth with a certain orientation aurora can occur at higher latitudes, and the origin of these auroras are much less understood. In 2014 Cluster worked with NASA's IMAGE satellite to explain the workings of very high latitude auroras known as ""theta auroras"". With the Cluster satellites located in the southern hemisphere magnetic lobe, and the IMAGE spacecraft having a wide-field view of the southern hemisphere, aurora researchers observed the phenomena more fully than ever before and could finally reveal its origin. They discovered that the lobe, an area of the magnetosphere which is usually filled with cold, unenergetic, plasma, does in some cases fill up with hot plasma when magnetic reconnection occurs on the night side of the Earth, thus closing the field lines and trapping the plasma within. Because the field lines are closed the solar wind can no"

This is not the only aurora mystery that Cluster has unravelled. In 2015 Cluster revealed, for the first time, the relationship between the bright auroras we are familiar with and the less familiar black auroras, the dark patches which stretch between their colorful cousins. In 2001 Cluster made the first ever observations of the dark auroras and revealed that the electron population of the ionosphere – the ionized region of the atmosphere where the auroras occur – becomes depleted in these dark regions. These black auroras are not the result of particles entering our atmosphere down magnetic field lines and striking atoms, as is the case with colored auroras, but of particles escaping in the other direction, emptying the ionosphere as they go. Fourteen years later, in 2015, scientists were able to use Cluster to develop the first accurate model of the electric fields and currents within black auroras and to demonstrate the relationship between the currents that bring particles from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere – creating auroras – and those that suck the particles from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere – creating dark auroras. Understanding how the magnetosphere and ionosphere exchange particles is not just an exercise in satisfying curiosity. Changes in the number of electrons in the ionosphere can affect GPS signals reducing the accuracy of their navigation and timing, and have"

Understanding the ionosphere and being able to make predictions using models like those developed with Cluster is vital in our modern society. 9) Clues to a life-giving atmosphere: Cluster has shown that the Earth's magnetic field plays a vital role in keeping our atmosphere in place and allowing life to thrive, but how particles move within the magnetosphere, and where the plasma within it comes from, are equally important to understand and this too has been probed by the Cluster quartet. Until 2013 the flow of plasma from the plasmasphere to the outer magnetosphere had only been observed in short bursts, known as plumes, which, even combined with the biggest contributor of plasma to our magnetosphere – the solar wind – could not account for the replenishment of plasma predicted in models. It was the capabilities of Cluster that enabled scientists to resolve this issue. Cluster data were used to identify a leakage of material from the plasmasphere outwards – a leak that constantly transfers material to the magnetosphere. Rather than looking just at plumes of material, there is now evidence of a steady wind of plasma from plasmasphere to magnetosphere, transferring almost 90 tonnes of plasma each day. This research was further built upon in 2016 using Cluster data to compare the steady leakage of Earth's atmosphere with the sporadic plumes that emanate from the plasmasphere (see Figure 31).

Based on data collected by ESA's Cluster and NASA's THEMIS missions over several years, the study revealed that turbulence is the key, making this process a hundred times more efficient than in the solar wind. - The planets in the Solar System, including our Earth, are bathed in the solar wind, a supersonic flow of highly energetic, charged particles relentlessly released by the Sun. Our planet and a few others stand out in this all-pervasive stream of particles: these are the planets that have a magnetic field of their own, and so represent an obstacle to the sweeping power of the solar wind. - It is the interaction between Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind that creates the intricate structure of the magnetosphere, a protective bubble that shields our planet from the vast majority of solar wind particles. - So far, scientists have achieved a fairly good understanding of the physical processes that take place in the solar wind plasma and in the magnetosphere.

Lina is the lead author of a new study that quantifies, for the first time, the role of turbulence in the magnetosheath. The results are published in Physical Review Letters. - ""In the solar wind, we know that turbulence contributes to the dissipation of energy from large scales of hundreds of thousands of kilometers to smaller scales of a kilometer, where plasma particles are heated up and accelerated to higher energies,"" explains co-author Fouad Sahraoui from the Laboratory of Plasma Physics in France. - ""We suspected that a similar mechanism must be at play in the magnetosheath too, but we could never test it until now,"" he adds. - The magnetosheath plasma is more turbulent, home to a greater extent of density fluctuations and can be compressed to a much higher degree than the solar wind. As such, it is substantially more complex, and scientists have only in recent years developed the theoretical framework to study the physical processes taking place in such an environment. - Lina, Fouad and their collaborators combed through a vast volume of data collected between 2007 and 2011 by the four spacecraft of ESA's Cluster"

Named after Austrian physicist Ernst Mach, it quantifies the speed of fluctuations in a flow with respect to the speed of sound in that fluid, indicating whether a flow is subsonic or supersonic. - While the energy transfer rate is tricky to determine unless using space probes that take in situ measurements, like the Cluster spacecraft sampling the plasma around Earth, the Mach number can be more easily estimated using remote observations of a variety of astrophysical plasma beyond"

As you stir your drink with a spoon, vortices are produced in the liquid that decay into smaller eddies until they disappear entirely. This can be described as a cascade of vortices from large to small scales. Furthermore, the motion of the spoon brings the hot liquid into contact with the cooler air and so the heat from the coffee can escape more efficiently into the atmosphere, cooling it down. - A similar effect occurs in space, in the electrically charged atomic particles – solar wind plasma – blown out by our Sun, but with one key difference: in space there is"

Although the energy injected into the solar wind by the Sun is transferred to smaller scales in turbulent cascades, just like in your coffee, the temperature in the plasma is seen to increase because there is no cool air to stop it. - How exactly the solar wind plasma is heated is a hot topic in space physics, because it is hotter than expected for an expanding gas and almost no collisions are present. Scientists have suggested that the cause of this heating may be hidden in the turbulent character of the solar wind plasma. - Advanced supercomputer simulations are helping to understand these complex motions: the image shown in Figure 29 is from one such simulation. It represents the distribution of the current density in the turbulent solar wind plasma, where localized filaments and vortices have appeared as a consequence of the turbulent energy cascade. The blue and yellow colors show the most intense currents (blue for negative and yellow for positive values). - These coherent structures are not static, but evolve in time and interact with each other. Moreover, between the islands, the current becomes very intense, creating high magnetic stress regions and sometimes a phenomenon known as magnetic reconnection. That is, when magnetic field lines of opposite direction get close together they can suddenly realign into new configurations, releasing vast amounts of energy that can cause localized heating. - Such events are observed in space, for example by ESA's Cluster quartet of satellites in Earth orbit, in the solar wind.

According to a new study, most of the energy dissipated during a reconnection event is not released at the crossings, or X-lines, between the two plasma flows but rather in swirling vortices, or O-lines, where magnetic field lines bundle up and spiral together. The new finding, which contradicts the accepted consensus, is an important step in the process of understanding the mechanisms that accelerate particles in space plasma. - Plasma permeates the cosmos. The mixture of charged particles – electrons, protons, and heavier ions – is found in the atmosphere of the Sun, in the magnetic environment of Earth, and in the vastness of interplanetary and interstellar space. - An important phenomenon occurring in plasma is magnetic reconnection, which happens when the magnetic field lines of two colliding flows of plasma are broken and reconfigure immediately afterwards in a different geometry. In the process, the energy stored in the magnetic field is transferred to the kinetic energy of particles in the plasma, accelerating them in the form of two jets of high-speed particles launched"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 95,"in opposite directions. - Magnetic reconnection happens, for example, in the magnetosphere of Earth, where it is triggered by a change in the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field carried across the Solar System by the solar wind, the stream of electrically charged particles flowing from the Sun. As a result, plasma particles are accelerated and can infiltrate the upper layer of Earth's atmosphere – the ionosphere – causing the beautiful polar lights, as well as disruptive magnetic storms that can interfere with satellites and telecommunication networks. - Scientists study magnetic reconnection using space missions like ESA's Cluster, which consists of four spacecraft flying in formation through the Earth's magnetic environment, as well as laboratory experiments and computer simulations. - Bridging the microscopic and macroscopic aspects of magnetic reconnection, from the particle level to the large-scale flows of matter and energy, is one of the major unsolved questions concerning this ubiquitous process. In particular, scientists are striving to understand how energy is dissipated when the magnetic field lines break, eventually leading to the acceleration of particles. - One aspect that seemed well established – the identification of the sites where energy dissipation takes place – is now being shaken up by a new study based on data from Cluster. These results call for a rethink of the standard view of magnetic reconnection. - Under scrutiny are the two magnetic field line geometrical configurations, X-lines and O-lines, which arise when two flows of plasma collide. The main X-line is located at the crossing of the two flows,"
0,Cluster,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cluster,EoPortal,EoPortal,Status of the Cluster-II mission 96,"whereas smaller X-lines as well as O-lines – whirlpool-shaped vortices where the magnetic field lines swirl together – may appear throughout the broader diffusion region. - ""We always thought that, in a magnetic reconnection event, energy would be dissipated at the X-lines, but the new evidence shows we've been looking at the wrong place,"" says Huishan Fu of Beihang University, China, lead author of the study published in Geophysical Research Letters. - ""In fact, most of the energy is being dissipated at the O-lines instead."" - Previous studies based on observations of magnetic reconnection events suggested that energy must be dissipated at the X-lines, which are the sites from which the two jets of high-speed particles are launched. However, these analyses did not include an accurate estimate of the location of X- and O-lines, as there was no method at that time to infer the magnetic field line geometry throughout the diffusion region. - The new study is the first to apply a recently developed method to reconstruct such topology, and it was this that enabled the scientists to reliably identify the sites of the X- and O-lines in the plasma. - The method, developed by Huishan and collaborators and published in 2015, was tested on data from Cluster and NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS), which also consists of four spacecraft, as well as on the output of three-dimensional simulations.

This was a rare and valuable event because the four spacecraft were flying through the diffusion region, only about 200 km apart, where they encountered several potential sites of X- and O-lines. - ""With our method, we could reconstruct the topology of the plasma that the four Cluster spacecraft had flown through,"" explains Huishan. ""We were extremely surprised to see that the electric current was very weak at X-lines, while it was very strong at the O-lines. This means that, contrary to our expectations, the O-lines are where most of the energy is dissipated."" - The new finding, which is in stark contradiction to the present-day consensus, suggests that something profound is missing from the current understanding of magnetic reconnection. - The strong energy dissipation at O-lines is likely due to the current-driven turbulence, which is also very intense at the O-lines as revealed by Cluster. Huishan and his colleagues have not yet uncovered how exactly the current drives the small-scale turbulence; they are planning to perform a detailed analysis of this process in the future. - This is a leap forward in our investigation of how particles are accelerated during magnetic reconnection,"" concludes Philippe Escoubet, Cluster Project Scientist at ESA.

Although missions such as ESA's Cluster fleet have long been investigating this leakage, there are still many open questions. How and why is Earth losing its atmosphere – and how is this relevant in our hunt for life elsewhere in the Universe? - Given the expanse of our atmosphere, 90 tons per day amounts to a small leak. Earth's atmosphere weighs in at around five quadrillion (5 x 1015) tons, so we are in no danger of running out any time soon. However, understanding Earth's atmosphere, and how it escapes to space,"

Cluster has been continuously observing the magnetic interactions between the Sun and Earth for over a decade and half; this longevity, combined with its multi-spacecraft capabilities and unique orbit, have made it a key player in understanding both Earth's leaking atmosphere and how our planet interacts with the surrounding Solar System. - Earth's magnetic field is complex; it extends from the interior of our planet out into space, exerting its influence over a region of space dubbed the magnetosphere. - The magnetosphere – and its inner region (the plasmasphere), a doughnut-shaped portion sitting atop our atmosphere, which co-rotates with Earth and extends to an average distance of 20,000 km – is flooded with charged particles and ions that are trapped, bouncing back and forth along field lines (Figures 31 and 32). - At its outer Sunward edge the magnetosphere meets the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles – mostly protons and electrons – flowing from the Sun. Here, our magnetic field acts like a shield, deflecting and rerouting the incoming wind as a rock would obstruct a stream of water. This analogy can be continued for the side of Earth further from the Sun – particles within the solar wind are sculpted around our planet and slowly"

In this illustration, the Sun is located to the left and the tail of the magnetosphere extend towards the right. Legend to Figure 32: The plasmasphere, whose toroidal shape is forged by the magnetic field of Earth, exchanges mass and energy with the outer layers of the magnetosphere, and scientists have been studying the details of the interaction between these two regions. Weaknesses in our magnetic shield: Our magnetosphere shield does have its weaknesses; at Earth's poles the field lines are open, like those of a standard bar magnet (these locations are named the polar cusps). Here, solar wind particles can head inwards towards Earth, filling up the magnetosphere with energetic particles (Ref. 25). Just as particles can head inwards down these open polar lines, particles can also head outwards. Ions from Earth's upper atmosphere – the ionosphere, which extends to roughly 1000 km above the Earth – also flood out to fill up this region of space. Although missions such as Cluster have discovered much, the processes involved remain unclear.

""The interaction between incoming and outgoing material in Earth's magnetosphere is a hot topic at the moment; where exactly is this stuff coming from? How did it enter our patch of space?"" Initially, scientists believed Earth's magnetic environment to be filled purely with particles of solar origin. However, as early as the 1990s it was predicted that Earth's atmosphere was leaking out into the plasmasphere – something that has since turned out to be true. Observations have shown sporadic, powerful columns of plasma, dubbed plumes, growing within the plasmasphere, travelling outwards to the edge of the magnetosphere and interacting with solar wind plasma entering the magnetosphere. More recent studies have unambiguously confirmed another source – Earth's atmosphere is constantly leaking! Alongside the aforementioned plumes, a steady, continuous flow of material (comprising oxygen, hydrogen, and helium ions) leaves our planet's plasmasphere from the polar regions, replenishing the plasma within the magnetosphere. Cluster found proof of this wind, and has quantified its strength for both overall (reported in a paper published in 2013) and for hydrogen ions in particular (reported in 2009). Overall, about 1 kg of material is escaping our atmosphere every second, amounting to almost 90 tons per day. Singling out just cold ions (light hydrogen ions, which require less energy to escape and thus possess a lower energy in the magnetosphere), the escape mass totals thousands of tons per year. Cold ions are important; many satellites – Cluster excluded – cannot detect them due to their low energies, but"

Solar storms and periods of heightened solar activity appear to speed up Earth's atmospheric loss significantly, by more than a factor of three. However, key questions remain: How do ions escape, and where do they originate? What processes are at play, and which is dominant? Where do the ions go? And how? One of the key escape processes is thought to be centrifugal acceleration, which speeds up ions at Earth's poles as they cross the shape-shifting magnetic field lines there. These ions are shunted onto different drift trajectories, gain energy, and end up heading away from Earth into the magnetotail, where they interact with plasma and return to Earth at far higher speeds than they departed with – a kind of boomerang effect. Such high-energy particles can pose a threat to space-based technology, so understanding them is important. Cluster has explored this process multiple times during the past decade and a half – finding it to affect heavier ions such as oxygen more than lighter ones, and also detecting strong, high-speed beams of ions rocketing back to Earth from the magnetotail nearly 100 times over the course of three years. More recently, scientists have explored the process of magnetic reconnection, one of the most efficient physical processes by which the solar wind enters Earth's magnetosphere and accelerates plasma.

Here, the cold ions are thought to be important. We know that cold ions affect the magnetic reconnection process, for example slowing down the reconnection rate at the boundary where the solar wind meets the magnetosphere (the magnetopause), but we are still unsure of the mechanisms at play. ""In essence, we need to figure out how cold plasma ends up at the magnetopause,"" said Philippe Escoubet, ESA's Project Scientist for the Cluster mission. ""There are a few different aspects to this; we need to know the processes involved in transporting it there, how these processes depend on the dynamic solar wind and the conditions of the magnetosphere, and where plasma is coming from in the first place – does it originate in the ionosphere, the plasmasphere, or somewhere else?"" Recently, scientists modelled and simulated Earth's magnetic environment with a focus on structures known as plasmoids and flux ropes – cylinders, tubes, and loops of plasma that become tangled up with magnetic field lines. These arise when the magnetic reconnection process occurs in the magnetotail and ejects plasmoids both towards the outer tail and towards Earth. Cold ions may play a significant role in deciding the direction of the ejected plasmoid. These recent simulations showed a link between plasmoids heading towards Earth and heavy oxygen ions leaking out from the ionosphere – in other words, oxygen ions may reduce and quench the reconnection rates at certain"

These results agree with existing Cluster observations (Ref. 25). • As of January 2016, the Cluster-II mission is more than 15 years on orbit operating nominally. • July 2015: For the first time two ESA space missions, Cluster and Swarm, joined forces to simultaneously measure the properties of Earth's magnetic field at two different altitudes. They found a number of striking similarities in the behavior and structure of the field-aligned currents they detected, despite their vastly disparate locations – Cluster being 15,000 km above Earth and Swarm at just 500 km. FACs (Field-Aligned Currents) flow along Earth's magnetic field lines, transferring energy between the magnetosphere and ionosphere at high latitudes. Their intensity is highly variable, much more intense during magnetic substorms when colorful auroras light up the sky. What this joint activity delivers is the ability to characterize FACs in the ionosphere and magnetosphere at the same time – particularly their intensity. - The three satellites of ESA's Swarm mission have the main goal of probing the strength, properties and dynamics of Earth's internal magnetic field. However the satellites' precision sensors also pick up the natural and powerful electric currents flowing through the ionosphere and magnetosphere, but these are normally considered as a noise source in Swarm measurements, with Cluster helping to disentangle them. On the other hand, enhanced understanding and eventually predicting of strong currents in the ionosphere is important because they can disrupt"

They will continue working together into the future, with more joint campaigns planned until 2018. • July 14, 2015: ESA's Cluster mission has solved a mystery which puzzled scientists for almost half a century. Data sent back by two of the spacecraft have revealed for the first time the physical mechanism behind the generation of ""noisy"" waves in near-Earth space. Very narrow-banded emissions at frequencies corresponding to exact multiples of the proton gyrofrequency (frequency of gyration around the field line) from the 17th up to the 30th harmonic were observed, indicating that these waves are generated by the proton distributions. - Back in 1966, the NASA satellite OGO-3 (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-3) discovered 'noisy' plasma waves at an altitude of around 18 000 km above the Earth. The waves occurred very close to the equatorial plane of the planet's magnetic field – the geomagnetic equator. - The location of the electric and magnetic fields of these waves, together with their unstructured nature, led to them being termed 'equatorial noise'. This 'noise' turned out to be one of the most frequently observed emissions in near-Earth space, being detected by many spacecraft as they fly over the geomagnetic equator. - Observations over the years by various space missions showed some evidence for discrete frequency bands, suggesting that the waves may"

However, the width and spacing of these frequency bands appeared to be non-uniform and could not be accurately measured, except at low frequency. - Although several theories were proposed to explain how these waves were generated, their value was limited by a lack of clear observational evidence that could be used to support modelling of the phenomenon, and by the limited accuracy of the proposed models. - In an effort to solve the mystery of the generation and propagation of the equatorial noise, an international team of scientists decided to take advantage of the multipoint observations provided by ESA's Cluster mission. A specially planned Inner Magnetosphere Campaign was introduced, to study the structure of these waves in their source region. - The most significant observations were made between 18:40 and 18:55 GMT on 6 July 2013, when all four Cluster spacecraft were flying through the outer radiation belt, close to the geomagnetic equator. Clusters 3 and 4 were very near - within 60 km of each other - while Cluster 1 was approximately 800 km from the pair, and Cluster 2 was around 4400 km away in the earthward direction from the other three. - Observations by the STAFF (Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations) instruments on Clusters 3 and 4 revealed that the waves had a highly structured and periodic pattern, providing clear observational evidence about how they were generated. The data also revealed in detail their banded structure, the most remarkable example of these"

The observations of the 'noise' emissions were, in this case, much more coherent and structured than the majority of plasma waves. - ""The clear appearance of the regular spectral lines associated with the waves reminded me of a comb,"" says Professor Michael Balikhin from the University of Sheffield, UK, a scientific principal investigator on Cluster and joint lead author of the paper in the journal Nature Communications which describes the research. ""They were found in the precise frequency range in which equatorial noise is usually observed. This previously unobserved, well organized, and periodic structure provided definitive evidence that the waves were generated by protons."" - The Cluster measurements enabled not only the observation of the fine structure of the wave spectrum but also provided multi-satellite measurements of this emission at very short separation distances. The periodic pattern of emissions observed on Cluster 4 was almost an exact replication of that observed by Cluster 3, showing that the highly organized, periodic wave structure measured at least 60 km across. - The spectral observations, together with observations of particle distributions, allowed the researchers to calculate the growth rates of the waves. The Cluster spacecraft measurements also enabled them to determine the polarization properties of the waves, further confirming that the observed emissions were the same type as those usually observed in equatorial noise waves. -"

This arrangement refers to the ring-like velocity distributions of the charged particles close to the geomagnetic equator, where more particles are observed at high velocity than low velocity. The Cluster spacecraft were able to measure these distributions, and models used by the scientists definitively showed that they are responsible for the excitation of the waves. - ""Waves in the inner magnetosphere have recently attracted much attention because they are capable of accelerating electrons to relativistic energies in the radiation belts or providing a mechanism that results in the loss of these particles into the atmosphere – two fundamental aspects of space weather,"" says Philippe Escoubet, ESA's Cluster project scientist.

But after 15 years of complex maneuvering that has enabled the fleet to gather valuable data in three dimensions, Cluster-1 ended up in a rather different orbit – leaving it to reenter much later than the others. - Planning for a safe reentry. The delayed reentry exposed it to additional perturbations and undesired natural variations in its orbit, meaning that it might have reentered over the northern hemisphere, where population densities are high, according to Detlef Sieg, a flight dynamics specialist at ESA/ESOC. - By performing a thruster burn now, the team could bring forward its reentry date to match"

These will maintain Cluster-1's orbital position relative to the other satellites, while shifting the angle of its orbit and make the orbit a little more elliptical. - The Sun and the Moon will now affect its orbit over the next decade such that the minimum altitude in 2025, after the mission's science gathering ends, will finally become low enough for the atmosphere to capture it and cause it to burn up safely. - The 17 March firing – the largest in eight years for Cluster – was the largest of the three burns, and two aspects made it particularly challenging. There was uncertainty as to the amount of fuel left in the tanks, and the satellite's orientation with respect to the Sun was close to the safe operating limit. - Rare chance for unique science. In addition, the flight control team were asked to perform the burns while some science observations continued. According to Philippe Escoubet, the Cluster Project Scientist, an experiment was conducted, suggested by one of our recently selected guest investigators, collecting electric and magnetic data during the thruster firing.

EDSN will use the PhoneSat architecture and deploy eight identical satellites (1.5 CubeSats) in a loose formation to demonstrate cross-link communications in between the satellites to allow engineers to study the application of small satellites in space-to-ground and space-to-space communications. As an upgrade to previous PhoneSats, the 2.5 CubeSat uses an active attitude determination and control system utilizing reaction wheels to provide three-axis control and precise pointing capability. This will serve as a demonstration to determine whether small satellites could be used to carry scientific instruments that require precise pointing to fulfill their function. With an expected orbital life time of about six weeks, PhoneSat 2.5 will further study the capabilities of the satellite design in the harsh radiation environment of LEO (Low Earth Orbit).

This region is where the constant flow of particles from our Sun, called the solar wind, collides with material from the rest of the galaxy. This collision limits the amount of harmful cosmic radiation entering the heliosphere. IMAP will collect and analyze particles that make it through. “This boundary is where our Sun does a great deal to protect us. IMAP is critical to broadening our understanding of how this ‘cosmic filter’ works,” said Dennis Andrucyk, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “The implications of this research could reach well beyond the consideration of Earthly impacts as we look to send humans into deep space.” Another objective of the mission is to learn more about the generation of cosmic rays in the heliosphere. Cosmic rays created locally and from the galaxy and beyond affect human explorers in space and can harm technological systems, and likely play a role in the presence of life itself in the universe.

(O3)->Identify and advance understanding of processes related to the interactions of the magnetic field of the Sun and the LISM. (O4)->Identify and advance understanding of particle injection and acceleration processes near the Sun, in the heliosphere and heliosheath. The complete and coordinated observations from the IMAP suite enable fundamental insights through three levels of study (Table 4). First, IMAP allows us to discover global properties of the interstellar interaction as a coupled system, including the origins of particle acceleration directly from IMAP data products. Second, IMAP helps us explore global fundamental properties of the interstellar interactions and origins of particle acceleration using IMAP data products, simple physics-based calculations, theory, and limited 2D and 3D modeling.

These T&M activities connect IMAP’s in situ and remote observations, enabling tests of wide-ranging theories through the heliosphere, and closure for open questions at the heart of IMAP. IMAP measurements and T&M span poorly understood suprathermal particle populations, complementing other HSO (Heliophysics System Observatory) missions without expending significant resources to duplicate HSO measurements, as described below. The four IMAP science objectives lead to five overarching observational drivers: 1) High-sensitivity global heliospheric imaging; 2) ENA energy spectra covering core solar wind through EPs; 3) Neutral H, He, O, Ne, and D fluxes and flow direction as a function of time of year; 4) High-time-resolution (< 1 min) PUI (Pickup Ion), STs (Suprathermal Ions), and energetic ion measurements; 5) Complete solar wind electron, proton, heavy ion, and magnetic field measurements to resolve solar wind structures, CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections), shocks, and kinetic substructures. Measurements of ISD (Interstellar Dust), UV glow maps reflecting combined primary and secondary populations of H and He, and the latitudinal structure of solar wind provide supporting context. These complementary and synergetic observations are required to address fully the four mission science objectives.

LISM (Local Inter-Stellar Medium) Properties and Composition (O IMAP observations will allow us to precisely derive the interstellar flow parameters (i.e., interstellar He flow speed and temperature better than ~2% accuracy, as well as the flow direction) to determine the external boundary condition of the global heliosphere. IMAP provides precise measurements of ISN (Interstellar Neutral) He, O, and H to specify the ram pressure of interstellar flow, its Mach number, to meaningfully differentiate the flow parameters of O, He, Ne, and H, and to define accurately the critical BIS–VISN plane, which organizes the heliosphere structure and topology. Precise measurements of LISM flow properties from IMAP make it possible to provide: • the first determination of outer heliosheath properties that influence our understanding of all secondary neutral populations, • the fundamental physical mechanisms by which the interstellar medium interacts with the solar wind outflow including interstellar flow around the heliopause, • the charge-exchange coupling with neutral populations within the outer heliosheath, and • the physical processes controlling interactions with the interstellar magnetic field. Ultimately, IMAP’s precise measurements are critical for establishing how the interstellar flow interacts with and influences global heliospheric structure, which feeds into objectives O1 and O2. Current uncertainties prevent accurate determination of the interstellar boundaries. For instance, ~10% uncertainty in speed translates to ~20% in interstellar ram pressure. Thus, it is not certain if there is a bow wave or shock ahead of the heliosphere and there are even wide error bars on the"

When viewing the interstellar flow from a fixed vantage point (e.g., IBEX-Lo FOV (Field of View) body fixed perpendicular to spin axis), there is a fixed peak longitude of the observed distribution, which produces an analytic relationship between interstellar flow speed and interstellar ecliptic longitude (referred to as a parameter tube). On IMAP-Lo, the pivot platform allows for viewing from widely separated vantage points (across > 180º in ecliptic longitude) and therefore produces an array of intersecting parameter tubes, which determine precisely the interstellar speed and flow longitude. The width of the ISN spin-phase distribution is used to determine the interstellar temperature while the peak of the spin-phase distribution also determines the interstellar ecliptic inflow latitude. IMAP will derive the O and H flow speed to better than 5% accuracy, a significant improvement over the ~20% accuracy provided by IBEX-Lo. The accurate determination of H, He, and O flow properties is fundamental for IMAP to resolve the effects of filtration and whether the interstellar medium is isothermal or instead strongly influenced by turbulence. This advance is essential for understanding the kinetic properties of the local interstellar flow that controls how the interstellar medium physically interacts with the solar wind at the heliopause.

The LISM is the only locally accessible sample of extrasolar material and thus provides the state of galactic matter today in juxtaposition to solar material from 4.5 billion years ago. It therefore provides us with critical insight into Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the galactic evolution in our neighborhood, which is representative of the galactic habitable zone. Measurements of 3He+/4He+ from PUIs and D/H from ISN atoms are key observations for Big Bang nucleosynthesis, with 3He+/4He+ thus far observed to only ±20% and there are no in situ D/H observations. However, a first determination of D/H in the LISM was accomplished with IBEX. Interstellar D/H is a powerful probe of nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the MilkyWay galaxy , yet observations in the interstellar medium are scarce and line-of-sight integrated and ionization levels of interstellar atoms may vary significantly between the heliosphere edge and interior of the surrounding interstellar cloud. The D/H ratio provides input on stellar evolution, and its contribution to the local matter inventory and the Ne/O ratio has ramifications on the balance between volatile and refractory elements, which requires observation of gas phase and dust composition in the LISM. IMAP will provide the LISM composition measurements needed to move beyond qualitative constraints and include the first detailed abundance information from direct ISN matter. For D/H, this will be to better than 20% accuracy, ISN Ne/O to better than 10% accuracy, 3He+/4He+ PUI abundance to better than 10% accuracy, and 22Ne+/20Ne+ PUI abundance to better than 30% accuracy.

IMAP also provides the first accurate in situ measurements of the flux, size distribution, and composition of ISD particles flowing through our solar system. IMAP will provide detailed composition measurements (mass resolution m/Δm > 200) of 100 particles per year based on Ulysses-derived fluxes to fill a significant knowledge gap in our current limited compositional measurements of ISD particles.

Direct ionization rate measurements significantly improve our understanding of the ISN flow properties. Current knowledge of electron ionization rate inside 1 AU is only thought to be accurate to within an order of magnitude, but likely significantly attenuates the flux of the indirect beams of ISN atoms. The pivot platform will enable IMAP-Lo to observe also the indirect beam and thereby provide an independent measurement of the total ionization rates at least for He and Ne.

However, both IBEX and INCA (Ion and Neutral Camera) face challenges resolving the faint ENA emissions from the outer heliosphere. For example, Cassini observations were limited by Saturn’s large ENA source region and the small amount of time spent outside of Saturn’s magnetosphere.

IMAP resolves the temporal and spatial evolution of the Ribbon, the Belt, and interstellar boundary regions. IMAP provides high angular resolution (4°) global ENA maps from 1 to 70 keV (for estimated counting statistics) to resolve Ribbon-Belt spatial structure. IMAP also produces global maps extending down to 100 eV to cover the complete Ribbon-Belt ENA energy range, albeit at somewhat lower angular resolution. Finally, IMAP measures the complete ENA energy spectra (10 eV–100 keV) from larger, but distinct regions (e.g., nose, tail, flanks, poles, Ribbon, Belt) to define the morphology and evolution of heliosheath populations from the plasma core, to STs and EPs. Observations spanning this complete energy range are critical for establishing not only the origin of the Ribbon but also its relationship to the Belt.

In particular, for hypotheses in which the ENAs originate as solar wind ions, the temporal variability of ENA flux and its association with solar wind variation is emerging as a definitive test. A recent model highlights the need for high-angular-resolution measurements of the Ribbon. That model suggests that the Ribbon forms from the interaction of PUIs beyond the heliopause with preexisting interstellar turbulence via magnetic mirroring near BIS · r ~0 . This mechanism predicts that the Ribbon is double-peaked due to particle-wave interactions; this may be reflected in the possible fine structure seen in early IBEX observations (Figure 3). The existence of Ribbon fine structure (or a double-peak) is unconfirmed. The improved IMAP angular resolution (down to 4° for energies > 1 keV) is sufficient to discover fine structure associated with instabilities in ribbon and Belt formation, and potentially other heliosphere structures. Physical Processes Regulating the Global Heliosphere (O IMAP resolves how physical processes within the heliosheath control global heliospheric structures as well as the interactions among the solar wind, the local interstellar flow, and local interstellar magnetic field. The approach to this objective involves six synergistic sets of observations as follows. ISN atom populations and PUIs reflect the external properties of the interstellar medium imposed as boundary conditions on the global heliosphere.

These observations set the outer boundary conditions on the global heliosphere and regulate the heliosphere’s interstellar interaction. Energy partition between the various ENA populations is critical to determining the physical processes that regulate the heliosphere. With IMAP, we resolve the complete ENA energy spectrum by measuring ENA populations from core solar wind through PUI, STs, and EPs with statistical accuracy across the full energy range from 10 eV to 100 keV. Heliospheric structures, and the resulting distributions of ENA emissions, evolve over time on various characteristic timescales (e.g., McComas et al. 2018; Zirnstein et al. 2018a). IMAP resolves the evolution of ENA fluxes down to six-month timescales to track the temporal evolution of the Ribbon, Belt, and heliospheric regions at energies down to 100 eV. These observations allow us to understand the temporal variability of global heliospheric structures. Observations available from IBEX and INCA have not been sufficient to fully resolve the differences between the Ribbon and Belt and understand the connection between them. This lack of understanding further clouds the relationship between the different orientations of these two structures and how one or both reflect the external direction and strength of the interstellar magnetic field. On IMAP we resolve the Ribbon and Belt connection and direction and the strength of the interstellar magnetic field with a combination of high-angular-resolution ENA measurements (4°) spanning 100 eV to 70 keV and ENA energy distributions with lower angular resolution (to increase counting statistics) up to ~100 keV. These observations are taken"

The charge-exchange process depletes the energetic protons in the heliotail and makes the interpretation of the heliotail structure difficult. With the ENA composition measurement from IMAP-Hi, we also observe ENAs of elements heavier than H. Lower charge-exchange rates for energetic He ions allows their penetration into more distant regions of the heliotail and the production of He ENAs will help expose the global heliotail structure. Secondary neutral atom populations arise out of the interaction of the heliosphere with the LISM. As the interstellar material flows around the heliosphere, it is heated and deflected. With IMAP-Lo, we accurately resolve secondary ISN populations (of H, He, and O) to derive interstellar flow deflection and heating around the heliopause. The counting rates of secondary atoms are typically ~10% of their primary populations. IMAP observes these secondary species from multiple vantage points over the year, as needed to understand the 3D spatial structure of the interstellar flow near the nose and the distribution function of interstellar neutrals in the LISM. Finally, on IMAP we relate in situ observations of the origin of suprathermal populations and energetic populations at 1 AU to the ENA energy distributions. This connection lets us determine the physical processes mediating the plasma balance within the heliosheath. We do this by understanding the origin of suprathermal particles from highly variable in situ measurements (~1 min resolution) at 1 AU covering populations from solar wind core protons through suprathermal and energetic protons (O4).

More recently, energization by turbulence and magnetic reconnection are studied in unprecedented detail by MMS, while acceleration at the Earth’s bow shock at ion kinetic timescales is studied by ISEE, Cluster, MMS. In concert, the IMAP observations represent the complete in situ measurements needed to discover the origin of suprathermal tails from particle acceleration. The ~1-minute timescale extends into the dissipation range of turbulence and is needed to separate discrete episodic events in contrast to continuously active processes in the production of suprathermal tails. On IMAP, identifying the sources and mechanisms of particle acceleration near interplanetary shocks imposes the most stringent requirements because they move rapidly past IMAP. IMAP MAG transmits magnetic field vectors at 2 Hz, capturing the entire inertial range of ambient solar wind turbulence. For 15 minutes each day MAG transmits in high rate mode at 128 Hz, capturing kinetic range samples over a wide range of solar wind conditions. This unbiased high rate mode eliminates the need for a burst mode that would create biased samples, associating suprathermal transients only with prescribed trigger conditions. ACE and Wind data show that > 45 keV suprathermal ion intensities above 45 keV exhibit dynamic changes at time scales of ~10 min upstream of interplanetary shocks, whereas simulations show shorter timescales. On IMAP, we identify particle acceleration upstream of shocks from the intensities of ~4–200 keV/n suprathermal ions at high cadence of 15 s to 1 minute.

Other acceleration mechanisms, e.g., solar wind velocity fluctuations, compressional turbulence, the so-called pump mechanism, and reconnection islands, have longer timescales and are easily tracked with cadences of 15 s to 1 minute. The suprathermal observations required for IMAP are made in conjunction with solar wind ion measurements to resolve the relationship between accelerated PUIs and suprathermal particles with solar wind structures; fast, slow, and transitional flows; turbulence; transients; and CMEs. The necessary solar wind observations on IMAP include solar wind heavy ion composition measurements of C/O, Ne/O, and Fe/O at better than 30% accuracy and 1 hour resolution, charge state measurements of C6+/C5+, O7+ /O6+, and Fe(low)/Fe(high) at better than 30% accuracy and 1 hour resolution, solar wind ion and electron moments (speed and density determinations of better than 10% accuracy at 15 s resolution), and magnetic field observations of resolution 10 pT up to 128 Hz cadence for resolving shocks and turbulence.

The populations observed at 1 AU including PUIs from ISNs, suprathermal ions, and EPs are also present in the heliosheath globally distributed flux and likely in the Ribbon and Belt, suggesting that the physical understanding of particle acceleration and suprathermal ions at 1 AU should feed directly into our understanding of these processes active in the outer heliosphere and LISM. It must be emphasized, however, that the solar wind at 1 AU is quite different from the regimes of the outer heliosphere. For example, PUIs become the dominant source of internal pressure in the outer heliosphere and therefore participate in the heliosheath dynamics to a much larger extent there than at 1 AU. Thus, a central opportunity with IMAP is to develop the physical understanding of suprathermal particles so that it can be applied across the broad regimes from 1 AU out through the heliosphere."

For each, we chose high-heritage instrumentation and made judicious enhancements only where needed to achieve measurement requirements. For the critical heliospheric ENA (Energetic Neutral Atom) imaging and ISN (Interstellar Neutral) atom measurements, our IMAP team also led the IBEX-Lo, IBEX-Hi, and Cassini/INCA instruments; these three instruments effectively define the current state of the art for the required observations of neutrals from 10 eV to 70 keV. Direct cross-calibration of IMAP with IBEX, if it is still returning data in 2024, will enable creation of the IBEX-to-IMAP dataset to continue the baseline of time variations in heliospheric ENAs and extend more than 15 years of global ENA imaging (Ref. 3).

The angular radii of the scanning circles of the two detectors are carefully selected so that the lines of sight intersect the solar polar axis in the geometric location where the respective maximum emissivity regions for the Lyman-α and He58.4 nm glows are located. The distribution of the Lyman-α glow around the Sun reflects the latitudinal structure of the solar wind, existing because of the strong dependence of the charge-exchange ionization rate on the solar wind flux, which varies with heliolatitude. The distribution of the helium glow within ~30º from the Sun reflects ionization of ISN He by solar wind electron im-pact. With the solar wind structure known from Lyman-α measurements, observations of the modulation of the He 58.4 nm signal for the first time establish the temperature of solar wind electrons close to the Sun at all heliolatitudes, which is fundamental to understanding the energy transport in the electron fluid near the Sun.

As on IBEX, the IMAP observatory is a rotating satellite with a size of 2 m in diameter and 0.7 m tall. All of the science instruments will run continuously as it rotates in space 4 rpm with the spin axis biased on average several degrees to the right of the Sun, along the nominal incoming aberrated solar wind direction. This IMAP orbit, spin-rate, and pointing approach provide ideal conditions to perform both the required in situ and heliospheric interaction measurements. The primary in situ instruments (MAG,SWE, SWAPI, CoDICE, and HIT) measure the solar wind ions, PUIs, and EPs, continuously making measurements within the required two correlation lengths (~300,000 km) from the Earth-Sun line throughout the orbit. Heliospheric interaction instruments (IMAP-Lo, IMAP-Hi, IMAP-Ultra, IDEX, and GLOWS) also benefit from continuously operating at L1 and outside Earth’s magnetosphere,significantly reducing measurement noise and foreground. ENA instruments (IMAP-Lo, -Hi,and -Ultra) are mounted to the observatory radially about the spin plane with complementing FOVs that are pointed at different angles away from the spin axis. These instruments as well as IDEX are shaded by the spacecraft. As the observatory completes a revolution,the ENA instruments measure a complete ring of the sky the width of their FOV. As the observatory repoints ~1º/day, the measurement rings fill the sky and complete a global map each six months, as on the IBEX (Interstellar Boundary Explorer) mission.

IMAP-Lo adjusts its viewing direction with a pivot platform. The pivoting FOV allows us to simultaneously optimize IMAP-Lo for global heliospheric imaging and tracking the flow of ISN (Interstellar Neutral) atoms. For IMAP-Lo, we plan to focus the first year on ENA viewing of the tail region (10 eV–1 keV),first global low-energy ENA maps (0.1–1 keV), and the ISN He and O peak. In the second year, we plan to focus on the possible fine structure in ENAs (0.1–1 keV) for portions of the Ribbon, and by following the flux peak of ISN D and Ne, provide the first accurate determinations of the D/H and Ne/O ratios. Periodic, in-space cross-calibrations occur between IMAP-Lo, -Hi, and -Ultra using the overlapping energy ranges and sky coverage. Additional IMAP-Lo and IMAP-Hi in-flight cross-calibration is done with IBEX-Lo and IBEX-Hi during the 6 months after first data collection and continuously thereafter for as long as IBEX lasts. CoDICE-Lo and SWAPI and CoDICE-Hi and HIT are cross-calibrated routinely in flight. GLOWS is calibrated inflight by measuring EUV bright stars (standard candles).

Data include all of the important parameters currently provided by ACE, but at significantly higher cadence (Table 11), and also include several new key parameters. Continuation of the standard ACE data helps boost understanding of the science of space weather and makes progress in the understanding of the heliophysics system more quantifiable over time through forecasting metrics. Especially with the transition in2016 of the Geospace Model from the University of Michigan’s Space Weather Modeling Framework to NOAA, real-time data from L1 now drive operational, real-time space weather models directly. Even one bad solar wind density or velocity data point can result in errors,so IMAP’s higher-cadence data will be useful for identifying and eliminating outliers and improving overall reliability of the predictions as well as providing more precise timing. Equally important as extending the ACE real-time solar wind observations, is the testing of new space weather forecasting techniques driven by previously unavailable real-time data. Table 12 shows new space weather data from IMAP that may greatly enhance real-time forecasting. Enhanced electron fluxes associated with large solar events typically arrive well before the damaging protons and ions. Therefore, increases in electron flux can be used to predict the arrival time and intensity of solar energetic ions.

The decision allows a direct uplift to Europe’s Earth observation capability, expanding Copernicus – the European Union’s flagship Earth observation program – with a suite of new, high-priority satellite missions. In this explainer we delve into the improvements and what they mean for sustainability and climate science. The Sentinel System – new and improved At the center of the next-generation program sits the Copernicus Space Component (CSC), which includes a family of satellites known collectively as Sentinels. These spacecraft provide routine atmospheric, oceanic, cryosphere and land global monitoring data, which are made freely available for Copernicus Services and major research and commercial applications such as precision farming, environmental hazards monitoring, weather forecasting and climate resilience. The soon-to-be-expanded Sentinel system will incorporate six high-priority missions. Set to launch from 2025, each will bring new sensing capabilities. • Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M): This mission will track individual sources of anthropogenic emissions of CO2 with a relatively high spatial-resolution imaging spectrometer. • Copernicus Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM): To monitor land surface temperature"

What does this mean for sustainability and climate science? These new missions will complement the Sentinels and advance our knowledge about large-scale changes to the planet from natural and human activities. Some examples follow. Improved knowledge of emissions: The inability to monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from human activity at national and regional scales, is a major knowledge gap that was identified at COP-21 in Paris in 2015, and still remains problematic today. The CO2M mission will help address this issue by providing measurements to reduce current uncertainties in emissions estimates. Moreover, these new data will provide a unique and independent source of information to help assess the effectiveness of climate policy measures, and to track their impact towards decarbonizing Europe and meeting national emission reduction targets.

As detailed in the 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere we are seeing accelerating warming in the polar and high-mountain regions and reduced mass of ice sheets, ice caps and glaciers, reduced snow cover and Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. With increasingly rapid ocean and polar cryosphere transitions predicted in the near-term, it is critical to adequately monitor these sensitive regions as changes here will extend to the whole planet, with predominantly negative impacts on food security, water resources, ecosystems, livelihoods, health, as well as on the culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous peoples. Future losses from polar ice sheets remain the largest uncertainty in global climate and sea level projects, whilst their scale and remote, hostile location make satellite measurements the only solution for tracking change. The deployment of CIMR and CRISTAL will ensure continuity of cryospheric observations at this crucial time. Advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): The SDGs provide a framework for global peace and prosperity, encompassing (among other aims) food security, sustainable water management and combating climate change and its impacts. To meet the commitment of achieving these goals by 2030, and to take action, decision-makers need empirical evidence on processes and changes in land and water systems and on their socioeconomic and human health impacts. The LSTM, ROSE-L and CHIME missions will improve our ability to monitor forests, biodiversity, agricultural land, and changes in the water and energy cycles to understand in more detail changes happening in both space and time, in"

The contract was signed in the presence of Bruno Le Maire, French Minister of the Economy and Finance. The mission will carry a unique visible to shortwave infrared spectrometer. - It will provide routine hyperspectral observations to support new and enhanced services for sustainable agricultural and biodiversity management, as well to characterize soil properties, which is key to vegetation health. The mission will complement Copernicus Sentinel-2 for applications such as land-cover mapping. - ESA signed the contract for the development of the CIMR (Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer), mission with Thales Alenia Space Italy in the presence of the Under Secretary of the Council of Ministers of Italy, Riccardo Fraccaro. The contract is worth €495 million. - Carrying a novel ‘conically-scanning’ multi-frequency microwave radiometer, the mission will measure sea-surface temperature, sea-ice concentration and sea-surface salinity. It will also observe a wide range of other sea-ice parameters such as sea-ice thickness and sea-ice drift.

LSTM will carry a high spatial-temporal thermal-infrared sensor to deliver observations of land-surface temperature. Satellite data analysis for mapping, monitoring and forecasting Earth's natural resources helps to understand what, when and where changes are taking place. In particular, this mission will respond to the needs of European farmers to make agricultural production more sustainable as water shortages increase and changes in the environment take place. - While these contracts are for the development of these three new exciting missions, full implementation relies on further agreements. This includes an agreement between ESA and the European Commission, including a joint positive decision by the Commission and ESA and their Member States to go from Phase B2 to Phase C/D for the prototype missions and to procure the recurrent satellite units. This decision point is planned in the second half of 2021. - The European Copernicus flagship program provides Earth observation and in situ data, as well as a broad range of services for environmental monitoring and protection, climate monitoring and natural disaster assessment to improve the quality of life of European citizens. - Copernicus is the biggest provider of Earth observation data in the world – and while the EU is at the"

And while, the success of the first 20 years has undoubtedly been thanks to the strong partnerships between the EU, ESA and service providers, the program is evolving alongside a fast-changing landscape for Earth observation. - ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programs, Josef Aschbacher, commented, “It’s fantastic that ESA has been part of Copernicus since the beginning and we are keen to ensure ESA’s expertise remains a core part of the program. Copernicus truly benefits our citizens, provides jobs and leads to economic growth, and we feel strongly that ESA has a valuable role to play in its future.” • December 14, 2017: Thanks to the European Union’s Copernicus program, vast quantities of satellite data are freely available to manage the environment and benefit European citizens.

In order to put those at use and benefit the EU citizens, current and potential users need to be made aware of the power of the data and be given the means to harness it in the most efficient way. As a consequence, many new ideas and concepts in terms of User Uptake are emerging and exciting times are coming for Copernicus users! - One of the objectives of the EC (European Commission) is to maximize the use of Copernicus data by and for public end-users, which includes national and local authorities and policymakers as well as civil servants in general. - Based on this objective,"

Copernicus uptake activities in Spain are conceived to ensure that the program is better known and therefore widely used."" - So, why and how can public authorities and civil servants integrate Copernicus data into their water management workflow? - Copernicus-derived information can be complementary to in situ information which public administrations are already handling, and be used for reporting purposes such as the national reporting on the quality of water under the Water Framework and Nitrates Directives. - Reliable information and variables (e.g. water quality, soil moisture dynamics, evapotranspiration levels, water consumption in irrigated surfaces) have proven to be very useful for public authorities involved in the management of hydric resources. Therefore, imagery from Copernicus Sentinel satellites can contribute to monitoring the natural and available water resources of Spain and serve as an input for the respective river basins and water management plans. - Information from Copernicus services can also be of great use, for instance information from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service to monitor use of nitrates which end up polluting rivers, lakes and aquifers; Very High Resolution land cover / land use products in riparian areas; as well as coastal water quality monitoring"

This would have a considerable impact on the management and the decision-making process – as public authorities and civil servants who have more accurate information about natural resources, can take better informed and more efficient decisions, and could simplify reporting obligations vis-à-vis several national and EU directives. - The Copernicus program can also provide information on flood-prone areas. This could serve public administration to improve methods for delineating these areas, and therefore to better assess and minimize the damages in case of flood events. - Another takeaway of the session was that public authorities can obtain Copernicus information to monitoring mountain ranges and quantifying the volume of snow accumulated in these areas. They would be able to spot potential risks of avalanches and floods during periods of rapid thawing. - Antonio Ruiz Verdú, from the Laboratory for Image Processing of the University of Valencia, gave his view on the Spanish User Uptake activities and noted that “there are now good examples in Spain of cooperation between the administration and members of the Copernicus Academy in order to promote opportunities in the Copernicus downstream sector. This cooperation is helping to bridge the so-called Science-Policy gap”.

Hayley Evers King (Plymouth Marine Laboratory) summarizes her experience: “CODA is ideal for our daily business. It allows us to investigate specific areas and locate data for a particular region anywhere on the globe. This is, for example, useful when spotting algae blooms. The handling is particularly easy and follows a streamlined, user-friendly process. CODA allows us to select data without needing much experience.

This new marine data stream, involving products from Sentinel-3A, Jason-3, Metop and Meteosat creates a broad range of opportunities for the downstream development of applications, services and – ultimately – added value in Europe. For Hayley Evers King (Plymouth Marine Laboratory) EUMETCast is important because “... it allows us to routinely and quickly access large amounts of data.

The NGO uses the software and Copernicus products to strengthen the drought monitoring capacity in the region. This is helping decision makers -such as the Government of Mali - to operate their own drought detection system, as a component of the national early warning system. To further democratize the information, the next step is to deliver information directly to herders. - Over the years, rainfall in the West African Sahel has become increasingly volatile, with years of floods preceding extreme droughts. These climatic shocks place millions of people in a precarious and vulnerable situation, which is more acutely felt by livestock herders. - In countries such as Mali and Niger, the majority of cattle are held in semi-nomadic herds that move according to the seasons in search of greener pasture and water. As the Sahel has a single rainy season of 3-4 months between July and October, herders need to make careful decisions on moving their cattle, ensuring that their animals stay healthy and survive the long dry season. For the communities in the region a poor rainy season can severely affect their way of living. Family herds that took decades to form can be decimated in only a few months."

For example, ocean forecasting is important for maritime safety and off-shore operations, and biological productivity helps sectors such as the fishing industry. It is therefore imperative to monitor data quality throughout a satellite’s life – and this means venturing out to make in situ measurements that can be compared with measurements taken from space. Two recent expeditions that took scientists 26,000 km across the Atlantic Ocean have returned critical information to make sure that the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are delivering accurate data about the state of our oceans. In 2016 and 2017, a team of scientists did just this and braved the seas for months on voyages that took them all the way from the UK to the South Atlantic to collect reference measurements of chlorophyll, sea temperature and more. ESA ocean scientist Craig Donlon explained, “We rely on these measurements, which are fully traceable, independent and collected according to strict protocols. They are an essential part of making sure that the satellite data can be used with confidence for practical applications and scientific research.” Gavin Tilstone from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) said, “Each expedition took around seven weeks.

Regular-repeat campaigns are a core part of our satellite missions because they provide the evidence of mission quality for our users.” The Copernicus Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites return different types of data about the oceans. For example, Sentinel-1 can be used to look at waves and oil spills, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 both offer information about phytoplankton, which form the basis of the marine food chain and are important in the balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Sentinel-3 is also used to map SST (Sea Surface Temperature), which is needed for forecasting.

A new modulation scheme has been designed and implemented and all Sentinels make use of the same payload data transmission subsystem, the X-band TXA (Transmission Assembly). In addition, Sentinel-1 and -2 are being equipped with an additional downlink subsystem, an OCP (Optical Communications Payload), including a Laser Communication Terminal (LCT) to transmit instrument data a geostationary data relay system, the EDRS (European Data Relay System) to the ground. There are two downlink channels available. Each channel has an effective downlink rate of 260 Mbit/s.

Hence the GCMs are contributors of the GSC, which can be seen as a System of Systems.

EUMETSAT will fly the Copernicus Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 atmosphere monitoring instruments on its Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) and MetOp Second-Generation (MetOp-SG) satellites, respectively, delivering unparalleled data services to Copernicus users. The operations of the Sentinels have been entrusted to ESA and to EUMETSAT, according to their specific know-how. The Sentinels are owned by the European Union. One aspect, which makes Copernicus unique and distinguishes it from satellite missions of other countries, is the fact that the European Commission has entrusted service operators with implementation tasks to develop, ramp-up and operate the various Copernicus Services with the aim of transforming satellite data into user-friendly information and products. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Mercator Océan have been tasked with running the Atmosphere, Climate Change and Marine services. The emergency service is run by a consortium coordinated by e-Geos. Moreover, the European Environment Agency (EEA) is in charge of the land service and will coordinate the provision of data from in situ infrastructure. Additional services in the security area"

Copernicus also builds on existing space infrastructure that does not form part of the family of dedicated Sentinel satellites. Thus, Copernicus provides a budget for acquiring data through ESA and EUMETSAT from satellites operated by commercial companies, the EU Member States or third countries. These are known as ""contributing missions"" and have provided satellite data for the program since its inception. They will continue doing so, particularly where very high resolution data are required, such as in the Land Monitoring, Emergency or Security applications. EU Member States contribute to Copernicus in several ways: through the provision of nationally-owned space infrastructures, through the supply of data from non-space (“in situ”) data sources, or by participating, under the coordination of the European Commission, in the “collaborative ground segments”, in which Member States can have direct access to Sentinel data by funding and developing their own ground segment facilities (processing and archiving centers, country-specific applications, etc.). As a global actor on the world stage, the EU requires independent information on how its policies and decisions impact and interact with other countries and regions in the rest of the world. Copernicus provides Europe with an autonomous capacity for Earth Observation, whilst simultaneously setting the stage for European participation in global initiatives both bilateral and multilateral.

By making its data, analyses, forecasts and maps freely available, Copernicus contributes towards the development of new innovative applications and services, tailored to the needs of specific groups of users, which touch on a variety of economic and cultural activities. The Sentinel missions mark a new era in Earth observation focusing on delivering a wealth of operational data for decades to come. The six different missions carry a range of state-of-the-art technologies to supply a stream of complementary imagery and data tailored to the needs of Europe’s environmental monitoring Copernicus program. 1) “Global Monitoring for Environment and Security,” EC/ESA team, Final Report for the GMES Initial Period (2001-2003), Feb. 10, 2004 3) V.

The SLIM6 design provides for a nadir-viewing, three-band multispectral scanning camera capable of providing mid-resolution image information of the Earth's surface. Three spectral bands are provided in the ranges: 0.52-0.62 µm (green), 0.63-0.69 µm (red), and 0.76-0.9 µm (NIR). The SLIM6 bands come closely to those of Landsat-7 bands 2, 3, and 4.

On-orbit calibration techniques have evolved given experience with the first generation system, the radiometric accuracy prior and following launch, and the relative radiometric stability are specified. Spectral bands ( Each SLIM6 imager channel has a solid-state detector at the focal plane. The spectral filters for the bands are located in front of each channel lens. To protect the filter a fused silica radiation protection window is set in front of the filter. The detector output is digitized to 12 bits and processed either to 10 bits or 8 bits radiometric resolution. The pushbroom system is capable of providing continuous imagery in flight path direction. The source data are stored in an onboard solid-state memory of 2 x 2 GByte capacity. SLIM6 features also a windowing capability. This function was introduced to avoid a saturation of the storage units and add more flexibility during satellite operations. The operations strategy targets maximum imaging time in the sunlit phase of the orbit. Operating modes with imaging and downlinking data during each orbit, and imaging orbits followed by downlinking orbits have been developed.

A balance has been struck between cost and performance. Payload operations are fundamentally resource limited by the on-board power available at the end-of-life, and by on-board storage. In practice, the system is well balanced between these constraints, but there are cases where any of these becomes the limiting factor. Data storage becomes the limiting factor when the spacecraft does not transit stations on several successive orbits, and power is the limiting factor when the spacecraft transits several stations in a single orbit. 3) Information provided by Joelle Sykes of SSTL (Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.), Guildford, Surrey, UK 6) Information provided by Audrey Nice of SSTL and by Dave Hodgson of DMCii, Guildford, UK 8) Information provided by Alex da Silva Curiel of SSTL, Surrey, UK The information compiled and edited in this article was provided by Herbert J.

The MetOp program was originally planned as a much larger satellite concept, called POEM (Polar-Orbit Earth-Observation Mission), a successor mission series to ERS-1/2 on the Columbus Polar Platform (PPF design). However, this idea was abandoned at the ESA Ministerial Council in Granada, Spain, in 1992. Instead, Envisat and MetOp were born. Full approval of the EPS (EUMETSAT Polar System) program was granted in September 1998. The MetOp program is planned as a series of three satellites to be launched sequentially over an observational period of 14 years, starting in 2006 with MetOp-A (2010, 2014), it represents the space segment of EPS. The EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) consists of the ESA-developed MetOp (Meteorological OPerational) series of spacecraft and an associated ground segment for meteorological and climate monitoring from polar, low Earth orbit, providing ""morning"" service for operational meteorology. Within the framework of international agreements, the NOAA POES series will continue to provide the ""afternoon"" service. The MetOp series, although an independent development, is complementary to: a) the NOAA POES system, b) the EUMETSAT/ESA MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) system, and c) the ESA ENVISAT system, where MetOp completes the mission objectives of the original POEM-1 mission. Background: European needs for meteorological observations in polar (""morning"" and ""afternoon"") orbits have been generously provided by NOAA S/C and payloads (including some instruments developed in Europe) over the last quarter century.

A cooperation agreement between NOAA and EUMETSAT was signed in November 1998. The EPS and POES systems form together the IJPS to provide global meteorological data from the series. With EPS, EUMETSAT is committed to take over the morning orbit service from NOAA. On the other hand, NOAA will continue to provide the POES series afternoon service. Both services are coordinated and integrated, on the basis of exchange of data, instruments and operational services The prime objectives of the EPS MetOp mission series are as follows: • To ensure continuity and availability for operational purposes of polar meteorological observations from the ""morning"" orbit to the global user community • To provide enhanced monitoring capabilities (complimentary to ENVISAT) to fulfil the requirements to study the Earth climate system as expressed in a number of international cooperative programs such as: GCOS (Global Climate Observing System), IGBP (International Geosphere and Biosphere Program), and WCRP (World Climate Research Program). The aim is to provide continuous, long-term data sets. EPS is an end-to-end system composed of a space segment and a full ground segment (see Figure 60). The third satellite in this series, MetOp-3, is not formally part of IJPS, because its planned launch date falls already into the era of the US NPOESS (National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System) era, representing in itself the merged US POES (civil) and DMSP (military) series.

EUMETSAT is also directly responsible for the delivery of the following payloads: MHS, IASI, Argos/ADCS, SEM, AMSU-A, HIRS/4, and AVHRR/3. The last four payloads are contributed by NOAA under the IJPS agreement: CNES develops the IASI instrument with joint funding from EUMETSAT, and provides the Argos/ADCS, and in addition, part of the S&RSAT (Search & Rescue) auxiliary payload. EUMETSAT is responsible for the definition of the overall EPS system, the development and operations of the ground segment, and for the operation of the space segment. Naming convention of MetOp satellites (the information was provided by the head of the EUMETSAT spacecraft team on Oct. 31, 2006): The various naming of the spacecraft is due to the way the program development evolved: • MetOp-1 is the first flight unit built, MetOp-2 the second, MetOp-3 the third. • Due to programmatic reasons at system level, a decision was taken to fly MetOp-2 first."

The SVM provides all the standard service functions of a S/C, like: attitude and orbit control, propulsion, power generation, and the on-board data handling and distribution systems. The SVM design is based on the SPOT MK3 bus (used on the SPOT series, ERS-1/2 and Helios-1A and 1B S/C). SVM is a box-shaped structure interfacing with the launch vehicle and the PLM as illustrated in Figure 5. • PLM provides accommodation and supporting subsystems (data handling, power, communications) to the payload complement. The instruments and antennas are mounted on the external panels, while most of the electronics systems are accommodated inside the PLM. The S/C overall size is: 6.2 m x 3.4 m x 3.40 m (launch configuration) and 17.6 m x 6.7 m x 5.4 m (on-orbit configuration). The S/C is three-axis stabilized. The AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) is in charge of the automatic 3-axes control of the satellite attitude, the orbit control for which the needed thrust impulses are provided by the propulsion subsystem. Attitude sensing is provided by digital Earth sensors for roll and pitch, by sun sensors for yaw, and by four independent two-axis gyros (two being in cold redundancy). Actuation is provided by three 40 Nms reaction wheels, by two magnetotorquers (MAC) able to generate a 315 Am2 magnetic moment, and by the associated monitoring and command unit (EAIM). In"

Two branches of eight 23.5 N thrusters are used. The pointing knowledge is: 0.07º (x-axis), 0.10º (y-axis), 0.17º (z-axis). The overall S/C mass at launch is 4085 kg, including 316 kg of hydrazine. Single sided solar arrays provide a power of 3.890 kW (EOL), the average power over one orbit is 1.81 kW (EOL). Five 40 Ah batteries provide power during eclipse periods. The mission design life is 5 years. The prime S/C contractor is EADS Astrium SAS (France), major co-contractors are EADS Astrium GmbH, Germany (PLM), Alenia, Italy, and EADS Astrium Ltd., UK. Propulsion subsystem: The eight thrusters, shown in Table 2, allow the generation of torque in all three axis and of propulsion in the ±Y axis. A graphical view of the thruster pair configuration is given in Figure 3. The Cartesian reference frame indicated in the figure depicts the MetOp satellite body frame of reference in which –Z points toward the Earth center. All the eight thruster configurations as described in Table 2 are shown in detailed in Figure 3. The rectangular box on the left in Figure 3 is a rough representation of the MetOp spacecraft that complements the thruster configuration schematics on its right. The green patches signify the location of the thruster pairs grouping on the spacecraft. Each thruster is designed to deliver a nominal thrust of 22.7 N at the beginning of life.

The thrust provided is in the form of pulses and are designed to operate at 8 Hz. During the propulsion phase, the imbalance in the torque due to changes in the center of mass will cause one of the propulsion thrusters to pulsate less than the other. A similar imbalance in the torque and thrust applies to the slew and anti-slew maneuvers as well. Throughout the maneuver phase, the attitude control thrusters are actively controlled by the AOCS to correct the attitude pointing due to torque imbalance created by the propulsion and coupled thrusters. RF communication: An omnidirectional S-band coverage provides TT&C support (uplink 2 kbit/s, downlink 4 kbit/s). Instrument data is downlinked in X-band at a rate of 70 Mbit/s. Onboard storage capacity of 24 Gbit (solid state recorder with a data rate of 70 Mbit/s) is provided. In addition to onboard recording and X-band downlink capabilities, MetOp supports the real-time broadcast of instrument data to local authorized users by the following means: • LRPT (Low-Rate Picture Transmission) links with 72 kbit/s in VHF-band for selected instrument data. • AHRPT (Advanced High-Rate Picture Transmission) links with 3.5 Mbit/s in L-band. The new AHRPT service (a WMO standard) enables regional users to receive all data relevant to their area in real time. Users operating existing HRPT stations will have to modify their stations to receive the ""Advanced"" MetOp data.

The digital LRPT service retains the VHF frequency and bandwidth of the APT service, but provides three channels of AVHRR data at the full instrument spatial and radiometric resolution. The EPS Ground Segment includes all the ground facilities required to support the orbiting MetOp satellites and the EPS mission, including both normal and degraded mission modes. Its objectives are: • To ensure that the satellites perform their mission nominally • To perform the ground operations to fulfil the global mission, acquiring and processing the global data received from the NOAA and MetOp satellites and disseminating the processed data to the Eumetsat member states. This includes product quality control, data archiving, and provision of user services. • To perform all the ground operations to support the local data-access mission (HRPT/LRPT) • To support NOAA for global data acquisition and telemetry, tracking and control during blind orbits of the NOAA ground segment (and on request for specific operations) • To support the space environment monitoring and data-collection missions. The core ground segment provides the following functions at the different sites: • Central Site, at Eumetsat headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany, includes all the functions for monitoring and controlling the satellite and the ground segment. Included are the generation of the centrally extracted products and their dissemination. • The Polar Site, at Svalbard (latitude 78ºN), hosts the CDA (Control & Data Acquisition) station that receives the MetOp recorder dump every orbit and command the satellite.

The EPS ground segment includes the Eumetsat multi-mission dissemination system (EUMETCast) for near-realtime delivery to users of the global data and products derived from the MetOp data for the morning orbit and NOAA data for the afternoon orbit. Onboard data handling: On the MetOp spacecraft command and control concept is implemented separately to measurement data handling. However, since this concept doesn't work for the NOAA-provided instruments (AVHRR/3, HIRS/4, AMSU-A, and SEM-2), a dedicated NIU (NOAA Interface Unit) has been developed to adapt the NOAA interfaces to European standards. The NIU performs command and control through a dedicated Instrument Control Unit (ICU) and collects measurement data through a DSP (Digital Signal Processor). It also compresses the AVHRR channels. To allow for selective encryption in the FMU (Formatting and Multiplexing Unit), the NIU provides measurement data to the FMU via four distinct data streams: • NIU (NOAA Interface Unit) • MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder) Protocol conversion Unit (MPU) • FMU • SSR (Solid State Recorder) General onboard data handling employs the CCSDS protocols. A selective encryption capability is used to ensure the commercial and data-denial needs of EUMETSAT and NOAA, respectively. Spacecraft operations are being performed by EUMETSAT with the Kiruna ground station serving as prime.

OBDH data buses are being used for data exchanges between SVM and PLM computers. Broadcast service provision: 9) The MetOp program, as successor to the NOAA POES morning series, is required to provide a continuous broadcast of its meteorological data to the worldwide user community, so that any ground station in any part of the world can receive local data when the satellite passes over that receiving station.

The IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer) instrument, developed by CNES, allowed them to catalog more than 200 ammonia sources, two-thirds of which had never been identified before. These sources are essentially sites of intensive livestock production and industrial activity. - For the last twelve years, the IASI interferometer on board three successive MetOp satellites have been providing scientists with global data on various atmospheric components, including ammonia. Atmospheric ammonia merits particular attention because it breaks down into fine ammonium salt particles that degrade the quality of the air we breathe. Yet the processes regulating concentrations of this gas are still poorly understood, especially on the local scale. - Using the daily data on ammonia levels recorded by the interferometers over a period spanning nearly ten years, the researchers generated a map of the global atmospheric distribution of ammonia whose resolution is on the order of a square kilometer. By combining their map with satellite imagery, they uncovered and categorized 241 point sources of anthropogenic NH3 emissions — 83 linked to intensive livestock production and 158 to industrial activity — as well as 178 wider emission zones. - In addition to recording new sources not found on current emission inventories, the study has shown that levels of emissions from previously identified sources are greatly underestimated.

The first signal received came from a beacon installed on a Senegalese fishing boat off Dakar, a tracking : first step for a sustainable management of marine resources. - This instrument brings to seven the number of Argos instruments currently in orbit, thus strengthening the Argos constellation which connects about 18,000 active beacons each month. - From 2019, Kinéis will operate the Argos system and, with the launch of its constellation of 20 nanosatellites in 2021, will be able to give access to a space IoT to a large audience. - Note: With the support of CNES, CLS (Collecte Location Satellites) a subsidiary of CNES, announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Kinéis. Kinéis aims to become a major player in NewSpace and allow, by 2030, several million objects to be connected wherever they are on the surface of the globe. Professionals and the general public will have access to a global satellite location and connectivity service, very easy to use and very affordable. The"

This constellation will be put into orbit as early as 2021. • November 12, 2018: Mission teams at ESA's ESOC operations center in Germany handed control of the recently launched MetOp-C satellite to EUMETSAT (European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) on Saturday morning, just three days after launch. In doing so, they also say a final farewell to the extremely successful MetOp-series of weather-probing satellites. - MetOp-C was launched into orbit on 7 November on top of a Soyuz rocket. Since then, teams at ESA's mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, have been carefully introducing the satellite to its new home in space. - In space, MetOp-C joins its siblings MetOp-A and MetOp-B, two satellites that have already reduced errors in one-day weather forecasts by up to 27 percent. - Now that MetOp-C is safely in orbit, and following in the footsteps of the previous two, ESA has handed over the mission to EUMETSAT for in-orbit commissioning, the start of routine operations and, later, distribution of its vital meteorological data. • September 6, 2018: Zenith GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data collected through the Precise Orbit Determination (POD) antennas of the GRAS receivers flying on the MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites can also be exploited to determine the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the topside ionosphere from the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) GRAS receiver to any GNSS satellite in view. These 'slant' TEC data are used to"

The MetOp satellites in orbit have demonstrated their significant contribution to the accuracy of weather prediction and still represent the most advanced polar-orbiting meteorological satellites in the world. • December 8, 2016: The EUMETSAT Council agreed that the ageing, but still healthy, MetOp-A satellite will be exploited on a ""drifting"" orbit from June 2017 onwards, in order to extend its useful lifetime from 2019 to 2022. - The nominal ground track will be maintained, but the local time at ascending node will decrease from the nominal mission value of 21:30 hr in June 2017 to 19:30 hr in 2021. This measure will enable two to three years of tri-MetOp operations with MetOp-B and MetOp-C as from 2019, after the end of MetOp-C commissioning. The launch of MetOp-C is currently planned for October 2018. Operating MetOp-A in a drifting orbit will maximize the return on investments of EUMETSAT Member States and benefit the worldwide NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) user community. - At the end of its operational life, MetOp-A will then be de-orbited to a lower perigee orbit for reentry within 25 years, in line with the policy adopted by Council to comply as far as possible with space debris mitigation guidelines, although MetOp satellites were designed long before these guidelines were established. - The development of the EPS-EP (EUMETSAT Polar System of Second Generation) system progressed further at"

Each SAF is a consortium developing and providing EUMETSAT operational products and software for use in a specific application area. The CDOP-3 covers the period 2017-2022 and will further extend EUMETSAT's portfolio of operational products and develop new products extracted from Meteosat Third Generation and EPS-SG observations. • October 19, 2016: MetOp-A, Europe's first polar orbiting weather satellite, still going strong after 10 years - double its specified lifetime. High precision weather data helps businesses, farmers and security organizations. - Global economic activity has become increasingly dependent on – and affected by – weather. Accurate weather forecasts are essential for sectors including energy, transportation, construction, agriculture and tourism, enabling them to plan and use resources more effectively and efficiently. - Dieter Klaes, program scientist at EUMETSAT said: ""The MetOp satellites have significantly"
0,MetOp,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop,EoPortal,EoPortal,MetOp-A Satellite 21,"improved numerical weather prediction. By itself MetOp-A contributes roughly 25% of all data gathered for meteorological purposes, and 38% of all satellite platforms. The MetOp fleet's performance in measuring trace gases and in the field of atmospheric chemistry, e.g. methane, sulphur dioxide, volcanic ash, has exceeded all expectations. Furthermore, climate and environmental monitoring benefits from the long-lasting program with three satellites designed to operate for more than two decades."" - Since its launch in October 2006, MetOp-A has operated like clockwork and has achieved double its designed five-year lifetime. In September 2012 MetOp-B, the second in the series, was launched and operates in tandem with MetOp-A. The two satellites fly the same orbit, half an orbit apart, to better observe rapid atmosphere evolutions. The duo has increased the wealth of data even further, collecting data from low Earth orbit essential for accurate forecasts up to 12 days ahead. MetOp-C is scheduled for launch in 2018. - In the MSG (MetOp Second Generation), currently being developed by Airbus Defence and Space, there will be a fleet of six satellites, with pairs of satellites carrying different packages to deliver complementary meteorological information. The A series of satellites (as of 2021) will be equipped with atmospheric sounders as well as optical and infrared imagers, while the B series (as of 2022) will focus on microwave sensors. - German insurance provider Munich Re's natural disasters report 2015 listed 1060 natural disasters in 2015 with overall losses of US$100 billion and 23,000 fatalities.

So far, MetOp-A has downlinked more than 100 TB of raw meteorological data. • May 2016: EUMETSAT has currently seven operational weather satellites. Meteosat-7,-8, 9 and 10, MetOp-A, MetOp-B and Jason-2. The Copernicus satellites, Sentinel-3A and Jason-3, are due to become operational in 2016. • EUMETSAT released a major update of the PMAp (Polar Multi-Sensor Aerosol properties) product on 17 March 2016. The new release extends the coverage of the previous AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) product, which was restricted to water surfaces. Now, this AOD product has global coverage, even for solar zenith angles lower than 70 º, and includes AOD over almost all land surface types, including desert areas, but excluding surfaces with snow/ice cover. This updated product also contains a realistic AOD error estimate. • October 2015: Two of the three MetOp satellite series are currently in orbit with MetOp-A close to its end-of-life operation. The three satellites are foreseen to provide polar data for climate monitoring over a minimum period of 14 years. - An observed discrepancy in the along-track acceleration contribution from the slew and anti-slew maneuvers of MetOp-B has prompted the development of an accurate attitude model to be used in the POD (Precise"
0,MetOp,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop,EoPortal,EoPortal,MetOp-A Satellite 23,"Orbit Determination) to improve the calibration of each maneuver segment. It is of importance to flight dynamics operations planning in understanding the actual contribution in acceleration by the slew and anti-slew maneuvers if an anomaly does exist between two MetOp spacecraft that have the same design and assembly (Ref. 8). - The performance of the maneuver calibration for each segment using the reconstructed and more accurate attitude model has shown noticeable improvement. The results from this analysis have provided a better indication of MIS-performance of the slew and anti-slew maneuvers of MetOp-B. Its along-track acceleration contribution is almost double the past calibrated slew/anti-slew maneuvers of MetOp-A. For proper comparison and assessment, it is foreseen that all past OOP (Out-Of-Plane) maneuvers for MetOp-A and MetOp-B will be calibrated using a reconstructed attitude model. If the mis-performance persists in all MetOp-B OOP maneuvers, this may indicate a possible misalignment in the coupled thruster on MetOp-B thus changing the direction of the parasitic accelerations. These accelerations contribution is observed in all three components of the orbit but it is the along-track component contribution that is of interest to flight operations planning. If a thruster misalignment is present, this will have to be taken into account in all future maneuver planning of MetOp-B. With the experience gained from this analysis and the basic resources developed, future OOP maneuver calibration in the POD can be readily performed for the future MetOp-C as well as the EPS-SG satellites to aid operations planning. - Future work: The analysis undertaken thus far has shown"
0,MetOp,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop,EoPortal,EoPortal,MetOp-A Satellite 24,"very promising outcome by accounting for accurate modeling of the spacecraft attitude during the maneuver phase in the POD. It is foreseen that further improvement in the maneuver calibration performance can be achieved by including the following: 1) Fine tuning of the start and stop times of the maneuver segments 2) Modeling of the parasitic thrust effect caused by the attitude control thrusters in between the maneuver segments. This involves defining more smaller thrust segments 3) Divide the slew and anti-slew maneuvers into sub-segments to better represent the actual force exerted 4) Model the thrust, especially in the slew and anti-slew, as linearly increasing/decreasing variable acceleration over time. • May 20, 2015: Four MHS instruments are currently on orbit (on MetOp-A and -B and NOAA-18 and -19) and are in good health — the only exception being one channel on NOAA-19. A fifth instrument will be launched on board MetOp-C in 2018. The MHS instrument is a radiometer providing operational data from polar orbit in five microwave channels, used to retrieve vertical profiles of atmospheric water vapor. These are key inputs for numerical weather prediction models, which are used operationally for weather forecasting worldwide. The MHS instrument was developed by Matra Marconi Space UK (now Airbus Defence & Space). • July 7, 2014: MetOp-B acquired an image of the super Typhoon Neoguri, so far the strongest typhoon in the 2014 Western Pacific season. The system became a typhoon, the Western Pacific equivalent of a Atlantic hurricane, on 4 July and intensified to Super Typhoon strength, maximum"

Legend to Figure 25: The enhanced infrared MetOp-B image shows the structure of the storm with a very well defined eye. The colors indicate temperature, with red showing areas where the cloud tops are colder than -70ºC. The well-defined eye can also be clearly seen on the MetOp-B Natural color RGB. The cyan color denotes ice clouds. Note: On July 8, 2014, the MetOp-A acquired Neoguri as it crossed the Japanese island of Okinawa. • On April 24, 2013, MetOp-B replaced MetOp-A as EUMETSAT's prime operational polar-orbiting satellite following the end of its commissioning period. MetOp-A will continue operations as long as its available capacities bring benefits to users. - MetOp-B began delivering first data within two weeks of its launch, allowing expert users to participate in the product calibration and validation activities. The satellite was declared operational on 29 January, 2013, bringing operational quality products from most instruments to the user community within three months of launch. - In the fall of 2013, the MetOp-A satellite continues to perform very well. MetOp-A will be operated in a dual operations scenario with MetOp-B initially until 2018 or the completion of MetOp-C calibration and validation. • February 2014: The MetOp satellites are Europe's first operational weather satellites in polar orbit providing data for weather forecasting up to 10 days and for climate monitoring. - On 17 September 2012, MetOp-B, the second of the series of three identical weather satellites, was launched, and joined its predecessor, MetOp-A, in the same"

The following year, in April 2013, MetOp-B took over as the primary operational satellite. - Although the ageing MetOp-A has now exceeded its design lifetime of five years, it is being kept in orbit as a secondary satellite, for as long as it continues to bring benefits to users and does not need to be deorbited to avoid generating debris in the precious low earth orbit. The two satellites are flying in the same mid-morning orbital plane, but are separated in time by half an orbit (48 minutes). - Dieter Klaes, EUMETSAT's EPS Program Scientist said, ""While MetOp-A continues to function, it means that the MetOp system is more robust to orbit anomalies and failures. It also means that with two satellites in operation there are more data being collected, in particular for Numerical Weather Prediction, the basis of modern weather forecasting."" - Global AVHRR winds from MetOp: The dual MetOp operation is also bringing other benefits. One example is in the observation of global winds, or Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs), from the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) instrument onboard the MetOp satellites. — AMVs are produced from satellite images by tracking the movement of atmospheric features, mainly cloud patterns, through successive images to estimate wind speed and direction. AMVs are useful as input for numerical weather prediction, especially over ocean areas where other wind observations are sparse. The AMVs collected by polar-orbiting satellites, such as MetOp, are particularly important as they provide coverage of winds in the polar regions, which are not"

Since 15 July 2013, GOME-2 on MetOp-A has been operating in a ""reduced swath"" mode of 960 km resulting in a ground pixel size of 40 x 40 km, half that of the GOME-2 instrument on MetOp-B which still operates in ""normal"" mode, with a swath width of 1920 km and a ground pixel size of 40 x 80 km resolution. — Rose Munro, EUMETSAT's Atmospheric Composition Manager said, ""This operational configuration has several benefits. The provision of data from two GOME-2 instruments ensures full daily coverage, without the gaps in equatorial regions which occur with only one instrument in operation. At the same time the smaller ground pixels from GOME-2 on MetOp-A, with more cloud-free scenes and improved resolution, are better adapted for monitoring atmospheric composition in the troposphere."" • Feb. 8, 2013: Satellites show that the recent ozone hole over Antarctica was the smallest seen in the past decade. Long-term observations also reveal that Earth's ozone has been strengthening following international agreements to protect this vital layer of the atmosphere. According to the ozone sensor on Europe's MetOp weather satellite, the hole over Antarctica in 2012 was the smallest in the last 10 years. • Nov. 2012: The commissioning phase of MetOp-B, also called SIOV (Satellite In-Orbit Verification) phase was conducted at the EUMETSAT control center, with the support"
0,MetOp,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop,EoPortal,EoPortal,MetOp-A Satellite 28,"of an Astrium team. It has been formally concluded by a successful SIOV review held in November 2012 (Ref. 19). - The detailed verification of the satellite platform and PLM avionics has allowed confirming the very good performance of the various subsystems and units for which nominal, and in many cases better than originally budgeted performance has been measured. The satellite resources situation at the end of the SIOV has been found fully satisfactory, with an ample power budget margin, and a large reserve of propellant due to a nominal launch and few orbit correction maneuvers. Overall, the performance situation fully compares to the one of MetOp-A at beginning of life. - Regarding instruments, the excellent data quality obtained from the very beginning and the experience gained with MetOp-A allowed EUMETSAT to begin trial dissemination of data to partners before end of October 2012. This covered data for AMSU, GRAS, MHS, ASCAT, AVHRR and HIRS. GOME data followed in December and IASI ones in January 2013. • On Oct. 24, 2012, the IASI instrument on MetOp-B produced first calibrated data. • Sept. 28, 2012: Four of the instruments on the MetOp-B weather satellite (AMSU-A, ASCAT, MHS, GRAS) have been activated this week and are delivering data. After a commissioning phase of 6 months, MetOp-B is expected to replace the services of MetOp-A as prime operational spacecraft. • On Sept. 20, 2012, EUMETSAT took control of MetOp-B operations, following the three-day LEOP (Launch and Early Orbit Phase) conducted by the European Space Operations Center (ESOC) of the"

All systems continue to perform excellently. • In June 2011, EUMETSAT declared ADA (Antarctic Data Acquisition) operational for MetOp-A. The EPS Ground System received next to Svalbard (Spitsbergen) a second ground station at McMurdo, Antarctica due to long-term international partnership agreements of EUMETSAT, NOAA, NSF and NASA. Hence, MetOp -A became the first polar-orbiting environmental satellite to achieve the 65-minute data latency operationally (see ADA project description at end of this file). • In May 2011, after 4 ½ years of operation, the satellite is performing well. HRPT data transmission continues, but with restricted coverage area due to potential radiation issues; Eumetsat increased the coverage from January 2011. The assessment review and trend analysis shows that MetOp-A could operate for another six years or more, well beyond its design life. • MetOp-A is operating nominally in January 2011. The spacecraft completed its 4th year on orbit in October 2010. All instruments are performing excellently, with a few exceptions: Eumetsat discontinued the LRPT (Low Rate Picture Transmission) service in 2007 and AMSU-A1's channel 7 was declared as failed in 2009. The A-HRPT data transmission continues in restricted coverage area due to radiation potential issues. - GOME-2 is operating well, although an investigation group has been set up to evaluate the in-orbit throughput degradation which"
0,MetOp,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop,EoPortal,EoPortal,MetOp-A Satellite 30,"could lead to some limitations in science data. MetOp-A deorbiting studies have started, planning for the first maneuvers around the MetOp-C launch date. - Since its launch in 2006, the MetOp-A polar-orbiting satellite has helped transmit data from thousands of animals, oceanographic buoys, weather stations, and other platforms around the world with its on-board Argos-3 instrument. As of January 2011, there are over 20,000 active Argos transmitters on platforms ranging from high-tech oceanographic buoys and weather stations to the heads of elephant seals. Polar-orbiting satellites such as MetOp-A play their part in the Argos system by relaying the data they receive from Argos transmitters back down to earth for processing. - On 18 January 2011, EUMETSAT commenced its extended AHRPT (Advanced High Resolution Picture Transmission) communication service. This enhancement effectively extends the geographical coverage of the AHRPT service to parts of Africa, Asia and the Pacific region where previously users were unable to receive the service. For the first time since the start of zone-based operations, transmissions will take place over ascending portions of the orbit, thereby further benefiting currently served geographic zones. Figure 30 indicates the new coverage zones for both descending and ascending passes. For spacecraft safety reasons, the service still maintains the same operational restrictions when passing over the polar regions and the SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly). • MetOp-A is operating nominally in 2010. All instruments continue to perform excellently in orbit. However, the HRPT-B system is transmitting in restrictive mode. - On Aug. 27, 2010, MetOp-A completed its 20,000th orbit delivering its"

No symptom of degradation has been observed since launch. From a functional point of view, there is no use of redundancy and no hardware anomaly. - All functional anomalies have a SEU/SET origin. These SEU/SET (Single Event Upset/ Single Event Transient) anomalies had a small but non negligible impact on the instrument availability in the beginning of life. During the first years of operations, a significant number of SEU/SET events occurred mainly over the SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly) region and the polar regions. The consequences were mission outages lasting from a few hours to a few days. A fruitful cooperation between EUMETSAT, CNES and TAS allowed to implement different ways to minimize the IASI down time w.r.t. SEU anomalies. The instrument availability was improved, and in addition the amount and complexity of operations in case of SEU anomaly was reduced. • The ASCAT level-2 Soil Moisture products became operational on Dec. 18, 2008. The trial dissemination of Soil Moisture products started on May 26, 2008. • The operational phase of MetOp-A started on May 15, 2007 when the spacecraft was officially declared operational after six months of commissioning. This official start of regular operations marks a new milestone in the ongoing development of the US-European Initial Join Polar System - and for the overall global cooperation between Europe and the US. It should be"

On that day 660 occultations were recorded, 338 setting ones and 322 rising ones. The coverage is globally homogenous, which demonstrate that GRAS will provide precious profiles over sparsely covered regions such as oceans and polar regions. The required number of occultation per day is 500, which is met with substantial margins. All performances for GRAS as a simple GNSS receiver and as an atmospheric sounder are well within specifications (Ref. 102). • The LRPT (Low Rate Picture Transmission) system experienced an on-orbit failure just 11 days after turn-on and the HRPT-A after 6 months of operation - due to harsh particle radiation effects. After the LRPT and HRPT-A subsystems failed, EUMETSAT engineers tested the system components in the laboratory and found that a component common to both failed instruments as well as the still functional HRPT-B was susceptible to impacts from particles with high linear energy transfer (LET). Particles with high LET are heavy energetic particles that create enough charge separation as they pass through semiconducting material to cause damage. Activation of the HRPT-B system was delayed until a plan could be developed to operate the instrument safely given its vulnerabilities. That plan required a better understanding of the space particle radiation environment, particularly the heavy ion population. However, the cooperative effort of engineers and"
0,MetOp,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/metop,EoPortal,EoPortal,MetOp-A Satellite 33,"space physicists from EUMETSAT, NOAA and NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) salvaged some of the capability of the HRPT by identifying limited areas in the spacecraft's orbit with low particle radiation where the remaining HRPT-B subsystem could be used safely. Upon completing the analysis of anomaly rates, NOAA physicists provided EUMETSAT operators with 3 sets of tables containing anomaly rates as a function of geographic latitude and longitude. The new operating mode accommodated customers in need of local weather forecasting data while still protecting the instrument and extending the lifetime. Due to these efforts the HRPT-B has been in use since September 2008 lasting now 3 times as long as its failed counterpart (Ref. 58). • On Oct. 27, 2006, the ASCAT instrument was switched on for measurement. • On 26 October 2006 the GRAS instrument was switched on. Within 23 seconds the instrument tracked a first GPS satellite, and 64 seconds after the first navigation solution was achieved. On 27 October, the instrument was switched to occultation mode and the first occulting GPS satellites were measured (Ref. 102). • The SIOV (Satellite In-Orbit Verification) phase started Oct. 23, 2006, following the MetOp-A handover from the LEOP service, performed by ESA/ESOC, to EUMETSAT. After a very intense period, some anomalies and many successes, the SIOV activities eventually came to an end and the SIOV Review formally closed this phase on 29 March 2007. • After separation from the launcher Fregat upper stage, the satellite entered an automated sequence which allowed to initialize its in-orbit operations. The solar"

The optical system is designed with two mirror Ritchey-Chretien on-axis obscured reflective telescope system with a concave hyperboloidal primary mirror and convex hyperboloid secondary mirrors and the field correcting relay optics. The mirrors are made of special Zerodur glass and are light-weighted to about 60% as in CartoSat-1 series. The mirrors are mounted inside the telescope cylinder made of CFRP with special MFDs (Mirror Fixation Devices) and the whole telescope assembly is mounted to the spacecraft structure through a special suspension arrangement. The optical system is designed to provide < 1 m resolution across track. The along track GSD of 0.8 m is achieved by apparent velocity reduction by a factor of 2.5. The spacecraft can be suitably biased to provide various modes of imaging: 1) Continuous strip monoscopic mode 2) Spot scene imaging (strips on either side of the ground track can be imaged) 3) Paint brush mode of imaging. This mode is used to increase the total swath. Both roll tilt and pitch tilt is employed.

The space between the trays is used by each subsystem to place its components. The components are mounted in aluminum boxes, the boxes are fastened to the trays. The trays are surrounded by 6 side panels, which double as structural members and solar array surfaces (GaAs and Ge). Solar cells are also mounted on the outside of the top and bottom trays. All panels and trays are made out of 6 mm aluminum honeycomb, except for the bottom tray, which is 12 mm thick to support the carrier attachment and to be able to handle the heavier launch loads. Some spacecraft parameters: body height = 23.5 cm, radius = 21 cm, total mass = 25.5 kg. The on-board computer consists of a Motorola 68332 microcontroller (16 MHz, 1 MB RAM). Power storage is provided by NiCd batteries (1.2 V, 5 Ah). Power is regulated to 5V and 8V, the average power consumption is 2.4 W (12 W max). Secondary power is provided by NiCd batteries. Note: An attitude control system was not implemented since the mission objective did not require any attitude control. However, the attitude can be estimated from the magnetometer readings as well as from the solar panel currents.

The IP (Internet Protocol) is used between users and the OPAL ground system. Launch: A launch of OPAL as a secondary payload to JAWSAT on an OSC launch vehicle (maiden flight of Minotaur launcher) took place on Jan. 27, 2000 (UTC) from VAFB, CA. OPAL was attached to the multi-payload adapter of JAWSAT, built by OSSS (One Stop Satellite Solutions) of Ogden, UT. In addition to OPAL, three other free-flying satellites (ASUSat-1, OSCE, and FalconSat) were attached to the adapter and deployed within minutes of reaching orbital altitude. Orbit: Sun-synchronous near-circular orbit, altitude = ~750 km, inclination = 97.5º, nodal crossing at 6 AM/6 PM. Status of OPAL mission: OPAL achieved its primary mission goal, all six picosats were successfully deployed (ejection was confirmed by telemetry), the component testbeds are fully operational. Extended mission operations focus on long-term characterization of the bus and component (magnetometer) testbeds. After launch and initial operation, OPAL has been designated as: OPAL OSCAR-38 (OO-38) by AMSAT, the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation. OPAL remained fully operational for 29 months. In 2004, OPAL was still semi-operational. Operators were characterizing vehicle health and gathering data on the testbed payloads. Focus was on magnetometer measurements and characterization. Sensor/payload complement: OPAL has three payloads: a) the Picosat Launcher and Payload as an end-to-end demonstration of a mothership / daughtership mission architecture and technology (the objective is to explore distributed sensing in space), b) the Accelerometer Testbed, and c) the Magnetometer Testbed. - OPAL"

Background: The original OPAL mothership system was designed as an FFM (Free-Flying Magnetometer) mission, sponsored by JPL. In this version, the daughterships carried precision magnetometers and were similar in shape to a hockey puck. A lack of funding terminated this approach. - New sponsors were found for the picosatellite mission. The launcher was redesigned to suit the new requirements. Picosat Launcher and Payload (research experiment and demonstration): OPAL carried and ejected a total of six picosatellites: StenSat (1), PICOSAT1.0 (2), and Artemis (3) as well as three from Santa Clara University: Thelma, Louise, and JAK. The picosat launcher consists of a total of four picosat launch tubes. Each is capable of holding two short (7.5 cm x 10 cm x 2.5 cm) or one long (7.5 cm x 20 cm x 2.5 cm) picosat. Six picosat flew on OPAL, four short and two long. A latched door with a dual-release mechanism was used to eject the picosats (single shot release and replacement of actuators). The firing was ground commandable. Note: The three picosats are the main payload of OPAL, a technology demonstration project funded for JPL. The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to launch hundreds of picosatellites from a mothercraft in low Earth orbit - to obtain simultaneous measurements of the magnetic field over a large volume.

The magnetometer is enclosed in a fiberglass package and is very compact (19 mm diameter x 4 cm long cylinder, 18 grams of mass). It provides direction information to better than 0.1º, while consuming only 200 mW. It generates three voltages proportional to the magnetic field in three perpendicular directions, with an accuracy of ± 0.1%.

Power is supplied by the top and bottom panel of six GaAs solar cells. Further subsystems are controller, sensors and antenna. The picosatellite is used by amateur radio operators world wide. It operates as a single channel mode ”J” FM voice repeater. The uplink frequency is 145.84 MHz and the downlink is 436.625 MHz. StenSat periodically transmits 1200 baud AX.25 for broadcasting telemetry. Additionally, amateur radio operators are able to “PING” the satellite by transmitting a six digit DTMF command to the receiver uplink."

PICOSAT1.0 is a free-flyer technology demonstration mission consisting of two tethered PICOSATs with the following objectives: • To demonstrate the basic functional elements of a low-power LEO “swarm” or formation PICOSAT array • To communicate from space using node-type radios and to report the results of MEMS-switched tests. The two PICOSATs, tiny boxes of size: 25 mm x 75 mm x 100 mm, each with a mass of 0.275 kg, were ejected from OPAL's spring-loaded launcher on Feb. 6, 2000, in sight of the SRI (Menlo Park) ground station. Each PICOSAT uses a small, battery operated, very low power radio with a cross-link capability. The PICOSATs are referred to by their nodal names as PICO21 and PICO23. The communication system of each PICOSAT employes a receiver/transmitter system featuring: a) a spread-spectrum DCT (Digital Cordless Telephone) chip set, a COTS product of Conexant, b) a CPU/RF board design. The system is operated at 64 mW output transmit power. The store and forward communication protocol is a random-access packet system operating at a frequency of 915 MHz spread-spectrum (20 channels) with a data rate of 80 kbit/s.

The simplicity of the PICOSAT design does away with such standard spacecraft components as attitude sensors and a propulsion system. The tether system of PICOSAT1.0, of 32 m in total length, uses a polyethylene 3-braid thread which contains 26 gold wire dipoles along its length, tuned to 430 MHz and 1 GHz. The tether was released from a tether spool right after the PICOSAT1.0 ejection from OPAL. The tether objectives are: a) to enhance system detection (the tether system serves as a dipole, enlarging the radar cross section of the assembly for a more distinctive signature and thus permitting ground detection), b) to keep the PICOSATs within range of each other (32 m max) for communication reasons (with each other and to the ground). A sensor board on each PICOSAT has a chip containing 4 MEMS RF switches (a 100 V charge pump on the sensor board is needed by the switches) that are operated in space after deployment. An A/D converter measures the resistance across each switch every time a switch occurred and records the results. Status of PICOSAT1.0:"

The mass of Artemis is < 1kg by utilizing a commercial microprocessor, transmitting on amateur radio frequencies from the picosatellite to ground, and using commercial off-the-shelf batteries to power the picosatellite. The primary mission of the OPAL picosatellite payload is to provide an end-to-end mission demonstration of mothership and daughtership technologies. The structure of two Artemis picosats is of size: 20 cm x 2.5 cm x 7.5 cm with a mass of 0.611 kg. The two picosats consist of the following subsystems: • VLF (Very Low Frequency) Receiver. The VLF receiver board is the main payload aboard Artemis. The objective is to research the effects of lightning on the outer ionosphere. Measurements are taken by using the VLF radio signals traveling between the ground and the S/C. Lightning discharges and the effects on the Earth's near space environment can be recorded with the VLF receiver. The VLF receive frequency range is 0.1-12 kHz, with 5 kHz considered typical of a lightning strike. The two picosatellites have different VLF thresholds, namely 100 mV and 10 mV respectively. Measurements are taken simultaneously by both picosatellites. Comparison of the data permits the extraction of the occurrence and amplitudes of horizontal and vertical lightning. • Power is provided by GaAs solar cells and two NiCd batteries, rated at 1.25 V and 800 mAh. • A microcontroller provides the necessary functionality to check for adequate battery supply,"

Rubber ferrite magnets are used as actuators to control the spin axis, aligning it relative to the Earth's magnetic field. • The communications subsystems transmits and receives over amateur radio frequencies. The data rate is 1.2 kbit/s. The third picosat, named JAK, was a simple beacon transmitter designed to test the ground reception ability of spaceborne picosat broadcasts. Mission operations: The picosatellites deploy their communication and VLF antennas after ejection from the mothership OPAL. Both picosatellites broadcast their call-signs once per minute for tracking purposes. Upon a command reception, the CPU initiates the VLF experiment by enabling the VLF receiver. The experiment is carried out in one minute during which the CPU counts the number of pulses the receiver detects above the threshold voltage. The measured data are downlinked in the next (and follow-up) broadcast until the next command is received. Status of Artemis: JAK was ejected with StenSat on Feb. 10 (both of them were stored in the same launch tube). No reception of JAK's beacon signals was confirmed. The limited battery life of JAK ended soon all communication attempts. The two VLF picosats (Thelma and Louise) were released on Feb. 12, 2000. However, no signals could be confirmed. 8) Information provided by Ernest Y. Robinson and by David A. Hinkley of the Aerospace Corporation. The information compiled and edited in this"

Figure 12: The STP-2 mission’s multi-satellite stack before encapsulation inside the Falcon Heavy’s payload fairing (image credit: SpaceX) The Air Force agreed to use the side boosters from the Arabsat 6A mission to familiarize military officials with SpaceX’s process of recovering and refurbishing rocket hardware. It is the first time the Air Force has used previously-flown hardware on a military satellite launch. “STP-2 is the government’s first launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy vehicle, and is one of the most challenging missions the Space and Missile Systems Center has ever launched,” said Col. Robert Bongiovi, director of SMC’s launch enterprise systems directorate. “We’re putting 24 research and development satellites into three separate orbits, with a first-ever four engine start"

We’re excited to be part of that journey.” For SpaceX, demonstration of the Falcon Heavy capabilities was a primary purpose. National Security Space Launch New Entrant Certification, reusability of flight hardware, delivery of spacecraft to three different orbits, and additional flight data for future launches were all objectives. SMC had similar objectives to SpaceX. STP desired successful launch of the six COSMIC-2 spacecraft, the single DSX spacecraft, the five ESPA-class spacecraft, and 24U of CubeSats without spacecraft harming each other or the launch, so each spacecraft would have the opportunity to demonstrate technology, provide desired data, and advance relevant knowledge. In addition, fourteen of the experiments on board were selected through the DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB); access to space for SERB experiments is STP’s primary mission. COSMIC-2 and DSX were designated the co-primes of the STP-2 mission by virtue of their driving orbit requirements, with secondary priority given to the ESPA-class spacecraft, and tertiary priority given"

In a joint memorandum obtained by SpaceNews, the two agencies concluded that they would not pursue development of a second set of six COSMIC-2 (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) satellites, known as COSMIC-2B, citing challenges to secure support in both countries.

An initial set of six satellites, known as COSMIC-2A, has been built and is scheduled for launch as part of the U.S. Air Force’s STP (Space Test Program 2) mission, launching on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy in early 2018. The COSMIC-2A satellites, operating in low-inclination orbits, were to be complemented by six satellites collectively known as COSMIC-2B that would operate in highly-inclined orbits. COSMIC-2B would be a replacement for the original Formosat-3/COSMIC satellites, launched into high-inclination orbits in 2006. The satellites measure signals from GPS and other navigation satellites as they skim through the atmosphere, using them as a probe of temperature and humidity conditions that fed into weather forecast models. Studies have concluded that GPS radio occultation data is among the best sources of data for improving the accuracy of forecasts. However, the memo, prepared by a joint Executive Steering Committee of U.S. and Taiwanese officials, found that both countries were finding problems financing the payloads, satellites and launch of the COSMIC-2B system. “At the senior-level meetings on June 19-20, 2017, NOAA and NSPO both acknowledged the difficulty in finding a viable path forward in exercising the option for COSMIC-2B,” the memo stated. NSPO is Taiwan’s space agency, the National Space Organization. NOAA, responsible for the COSMIC-2 payloads, did not receive any funding for the COSMIC-2B payloads in the fiscal year 2017 omnibus appropriations bill enacted in May.

Uncertainty about funding for those payloads, in turn, created problems for NSPO, responsible for the satellites. “NSPO has had difficulty to secure the 2nd set of FORMOSAT-7 from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) budget since 2014 because the funding of the second set of mission payloads remains uncertain,” the memo stated. Launch options for the COSMIC-2B mission were also an issue. NASA had proposed flying four the satellites as secondary payloads on the launch of the agency’s Surface Water Ocean Tomography mission, scheduled for April 2021 on a SpaceX Falcon 9. However, NSPO “would face technical, schedule and resource challenges” in getting the satellites ready in time for that launch. The memo didn’t state what plans, if any, existed for the other two COSMIC-2B satellites. NSPO added that its ministry had given direction “not to pursue FORMOSAT-7 Launch #2 given new priorities,” which were not stated in the memo. That memo concluded that the Executive Steering Committee “decided not to exercise the option for COSMIC-2B/FormoSat-7.” The joint program would proceed with the six COSMIC-2A satellites but “will not pursue additional FormoSat-7/COSMIC-2 satellites” beyond them. The memo was signed by NOAA officials Oct. 6 and by their Taiwanese counterparts on Oct. 16, 2017. COSMIC-2 had become controversial in the U.S. because of perceptions by companies developing their own GPS radio occultation (RO) systems that the government was competing with them.

In report language accompanying the 2017 omnibus appropriations bill, Congress indicated that it wanted to NOAA to consider commercial sources of that data alongside development of the COSMIC-2B satellites. “Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, NOAA shall submit an analysis of options for acquiring polar RO data that includes a cost analysis of all alternatives and demonstrates that NOAA has thoroughly reviewed potential commercial RO sources,” the act stated in the section discussing the lack of funding for COSMIC-2B. “If the plan proposes moving forward with additional COSMIC-2 satellites,” it continued, “the plan shall include the total cost to the U.S. government of developing, procuring, launching, and operating COSMIC-2 polar orbiting satellites, including how they would be launched and what Federal agency would incur that cost.” NOAA has not disclosed the outcome of analysis of data collected in the initial phase of the pilot program, where only Spire was able to provide GPS RO data. The memo, though, stated that NOAA didn’t yet believe commercial data was ready for routine use. “While the commercial sector is not at present a viable source for [GPS radio occultation] data for operational use, NOAA will continue to evaluate it as a potential source for the future,” the memo stated."

As an important indicator of Taiwan's space technology, FORMOSAT-7 is also the largest international scientific cooperation program between Taiwan and the United States in recent years. There is good news from FORMOSAT-7 a few days ago that all 6 satellites have been successfully deployed in mission orbits at the altitude of 540 to 550 kilometers on February 3, 2021, and 24-hour evenly distributed atmospheric and ionospheric observation data can be provided for the application of meteorological forecast and space weather monitor. - The FORMOSAT-7 program is jointly implemented by National Space Organization (NSPO) of National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs) under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States. A constellation of 6 FORMOSAT-7 satellites use the occultation technology to observe data and receive signals from the US GPS and Russian GLONASS global positioning satellites. They can provide daily atmospheric vertical profile data at about 4,000 points between 50 degrees north and south latitudes around the world, which can make up for a large amount of observational data that is extremely scarce in tropical ocean areas, which will greatly help the improvement of global weather forecast accuracy.

The atmospheric observation data was released globally in synchronization with NOAA on March 7, 2020. The ionospheric data obtained by receiving GPS satellite signals was released and announced together with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), USA, on September 15, 2020. The FORMOSAT-7 data is currently being used by many meteorological centers and research institutes around the world. Among them, NSPO, Central Weather Bureau (CWB), National Central University (NCU), and National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) teams in Taiwan, as well as the scientific teams under UCAR and NOAA in the United States make the most use of the FORMOSAT-7 data. In addition to reducing the overall weather forecast error by 10~11%, it can forecast typhoon generation earlier, improve the typhoon forecast track, and effectively monitor changes in space weather. - In the future, NSPO will continue to work hard to guard FORMOSAT-7, the role of clairvoyance, observing the weather changes thousands of miles away, providing the best service to help CWB and major meteorological centers around the world to grasp the situation earlier, so that the people can make preparation as soon"

This joint Taiwan–United States mission is a constellation of six satellites, providing around 5,000 occultations per day between ±40 degrees latitude. The satellites were launched on 25 June 2019 and declared operational on 25 February 2020, and the data became available on the Global Telecommunication System on 16 March 2020. - COSMIC-2 represents a significant increase in the number occultations available for operational assimilation at ECMWF, from around 3,000 per day (of which around 1,800 come from EUMETSAT’s MetOp satellites) to around 8,000. These new measurements have a large impact in the tropics, improving temperature, humidity and wind forecasts in the short and medium range. Use of COSMIC-2 at ECMWF - UCAR made the first COSMIC-2 non-operational data available in October 2019, initially for technical testing in NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) systems. As more data became available, they were used at ECMWF for extended impact experiments. - ECMWF has initially adopted a conservative approach to COSMIC-2 by assimilating the data in the same way as is done for other operational GNSS-RO missions. This produced good results in experiments from late September 2019 to March 2020. It is a sign of improvement when the short-range forecast is closer to data from other observing systems. Such improvements are found for almost all in-situ and satellite observation types in the tropics (see the figure for an"

Perhaps most significantly, there is a clear and consistent impact on the forecast fit to a range of observing systems that are sensitive to tropospheric water vapor. - Medium-range forecast scores are also promising. We obtain large forecast improvements for tropical stratospheric zonal (latitudinal) winds. The impact is statistically significant out to 10 days, verified against observations. In the northern hemisphere extratropics, the reduction in geopotential height forecast errors from the 500 hPa level and above is statistically significant out to 3–4 days. There are also global improvements in stratospheric geopotential height and temperature biases. Summary and outlook - The COSMIC-2 mission represents a large increase in the GNSS-RO data available for operational NWP applications. First ECMWF impact experiments with this data have been extremely promising, and they led to the operational implementation on 25 March 2020. The impact of COSMIC-2 on the forecast fit to observing systems sensitive to tropospheric water vapor represents an important step forward for GNSS-RO. - The use of COSMIC-2 is still quite conservative, and ECMWF will try to improve on the exploitation of this data in the future. We will test extending the use of the data higher into the mesosphere. In addition, following promising work conducted recently at the UK Met Office, we will investigate the use of observation uncertainty estimates that differ for the various GNSS-RO datasets. • March 12, 2020: Taiwanese and US officials have just announced that data gathered by the FormoSat-7/COSMIC-2 satellite constellation, launched last year, will now be released daily.

Using FDM for a project like this has never been done before and it demonstrates how 3D printing is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. While ULTEM 9085 has been well-vetted in the aerospace industry and is flammability rated by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), it has not previously been used or tested for an exterior application in space. Therefore, in addition to standard functional testing (i.e. antenna beam pattern, efficiency, and impedance match), FDM ULTEM 9085 and the parts had to go through further testing in order to meet NASA class B/B1 flight hardware requirements. Some of these tests included susceptibility to UV radiation, susceptibility to atomic oxygen, outgassing, thermal properties tests, vibration / acoustic loads standard to the launch rocket etc. The ULTEM 9085's properties met all required qualification tests. To protect the antenna array supports against oxygen atoms and ultraviolet radiation, a layer of NASA's S13G protective paint was applied to the parts. From March 2012 – April 2013, RedEye produced 30 antenna array structures for form, fit and function testing. As of 2014, RedEye was able to successfully enter the JPL Approved Supplier List and delivered 30 complete antennas for final testing and integration.

The IVM instrument employs gridded electrostatic analyzers to observe and characterize the in-situ plasma. Key observables: in-situ ion density, temperature, & 3D drifts (E-fields). All sensors are ram-facing. The IVM can measure the electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field and the ion motions parallel to the magnetic field through measurement of the ion drift velocity vector.

The project is supported by the Slovak government. The overall objective is to gain hands-on experience with everything involved in satellite manufacturing and to strengthen Slovakia's position within the European Space Agency's (ESA's) group of cooperating states. Investments in education and science are the only way to bring Slovakia to this ‘elite club'. The space program in Slovakia has to start somehow. We think that CubeSats are an appropriate way to get us there. It is not just student debris in space, but also an ideal way of gaining the know-how and experience in making relatively cheap experiments in space. Spacecraft: The skCUBE , with a mass of ~1kg and a size of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, was built essentially from scratch. Virtually all of CubeSat was designed and constructed by the project team, including the circuit boards, sensors, parts of the testing equipment, software and calibration methods The structure of the CubeSat uses aluminum which provides the required stiffness, endurance and heat conduction. Two solar panels are placed on each side of the cube. There are 5 pieces of PCB (Printed"

Dipole antennas and patch antenna will be deployed at the bottom of the satellite. OBC (On-Board Computer): The OBC is the brain of the satellite. It communicates with other peripherals, stores information to the internal memory and divides tasks. It is designed in a redundant way, so in the case of failure, control is taken over by a backup system. The heart of the OBC is the MSP430 processor with a static architecture and a connectable FRAM (Ferroelectric Random Access Memory) to improve its radiation resistance. Failure is equally detected by a radiation resistant watchdog, a component that monitors the work of the active microcomputer. The OBC also has a unique real-time operating system developed by the skCUBE team for a period of more than 3 years. COM (Communications subsystem): COM is a redundant subsystem. Its primary channel works at a frequency of 437.1 MHz (UHF) and is used to transmit telemetry housekeeping data using the AX.25 protocol at a data rate of 9.6 kbit/s. The team also developed an S-band system with a frequency of 2.401 GHz for the transmission of imagery at a speed up to 240 kbit/s. With colleagues from Žilina University, the team developed progressive encoding methods using LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) channel codes, which will secure a reliable reception even at low SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) levels. Communication inherently involves antennas. Here, the team had to figure out the antenna deployment and their release from their containers. The system"

This system was developed to be very reliable, so that for instance the antennas would not deploy prematurely in the rocket, and the resistors would burn the holding thread and release the antennas at the right moment. The antennas are crucial for the communication system, which is why a great number of concepts and measurements were tried before the team found parametrically the right antenna design. An interesting piece of the satellite's technology is the patch antenna for the 2.4 GHz S-band system, where the main problem was the available space for it. Thus, it had to fit within a space of 40 x 40 cm with a height of 1.5 mm. Nevertheless, the antenna has a good gain of 6 dBi and provides right-handed polarization. ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem): The ADCS is a complex system acquiring the position and orientation of the satellite, based on the information from on-board sensors the: magnetometer, gyroscope, sun sensor and Earth sensor. Both the magnetometer and gyroscope are small SMDs (Surface Mount Devices) with a MEMS structure, which are needed to be calibrated before use. The project used the system of Helmholtz coils and accurate fluxgate magnetometers for the calibration of the magnetometers. A unique component of the satellite is the sun sensor, which can be used to determine the position of the satellite with respect to the Sun. The Sun is a"

The sun sensor is made of a bilateral PSD (Position Sensitive Detector), which is subject to subsequent processing by an AD convertor. Its theoretical accuracy in its position determination can be up to 0.1º. Furthermore, the last sensor for position determination is the Earth sensor. It is basically an infrared camera with resolution of 16 x 4 pixels, which is capable to determine Earth's horizon based on temperature contrast. By optimal fusion of these sensors, the team can determine position and orientation of the CubeSat on orbit. The CubeSat will gain initial random rotation after deployment from the launch vehicle, needed to compensate and stabilize the satellite. For rotation reduction, the team will use the B-dot algorithm, which can control active coils based on magnetic field measurements. Active coils are electromagnetic coils with a core, which can interact with magnetic field of Earth. In fact, we'll use magnetic field line as a support point around which we turn the satellite. A big problem of such coils is the hysteresis of the core itself, which results in a remnant magnetism and which then interacts with further magnetic measurements. Therefore, the project manufactured a core with extremely small hysteresis loop. It took the team about a year to find the right material, do computer simulations, measurements, tests and build the core together with the wire winding. EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): The EPS secures energy from the solar panels, stores it in batteries (LiFePO4 accumulators 2 x 1100 mAh) and"

The design of the printed circuit board will last for about 2 years and it is the most complicated part of the whole satellite. The team had to fit approximately 1000 components into a very small space of 6 layers. Not all of the components could be purchased in high enough quality for deployment in space. Therefore, the rest of the components had to pass radiation tests, to be able to determine approximately their life expectancy. Based on these results,the original design had to be modified. Radiation measurements of the satellite's critical components have been secured by RCM together with the University Center of Electron Accelerators of the Slovak Medical University. The average power of EPS is 2 W. Development status: The project delivered the skCUBE satellite to ISL ( Innovative Space Logidtics B.V.), the launch service provider of Delft, the Netherlands, in April 2016. ISL will secure the integration of skCUBE together with other CubeSats into a so called flight container. Subsequently, ISL will deliver skCUBE to the VAFB in California and mount it to SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.

The goal is to use the system for the detection of so-called whistlers to study terrestrial lightning and Earth's ionosphere. The detector consists of a nearly square-shaped air-core loop/coil (Figure 2), which serves as an antenna of the VLF receiver, a coil with a 1000 windings and a cross-sectional area of 42 cm2. The coil signal is amplified, converted in an AD converter and processed in a microcontroller. Digital filtration of the signal, spectral analysis and event detection based on power flux density is performed on-board as well. The experiment works in 2 modes. The first slow one allows for the monitoring of the evolution of spectral changes throughout skCUBE's orbit and the detection of potential anomalies. The second mode executes very fast sampling of the detected signal, based on an excess of power flux density over specific limits, which will be set in the orbit. It will allow for the analysis of fast events occurring in the top side of the ionosphere. Properties of the magnetic loop antenna: The VLF antenna can be approximated by the diagram shown in Figure 4.

When samples reach buffer limits, the FIR decimates the under-samples input signal by a factor of 4. These output samples then undergo spectral Fourier analysis using 256 frequency bins. The signal is further averaged in the spectral domain. The spectral signal is stored in a circular buffer. Summary of the basic signal processing parameters: - ADC resolution: 12 bits - number of input channels: 3 (the multiple channels are connected to active coils utilized primarily for the stabilization of the satellite, but they are able to detect VLF radio waves as well.

The characteristics of such waves can thus reflect the charged particle densities in the ionosphere and the properties of the omnipresent magnetic field. Whistlers: Whistlers are typical radio signals in the VLF band from dispersed frequency components of the lightning spectrum. Travel through the ionosphere causes high frequencies to arrive first (Figure 11). Their sources near skCUBE's low orbit will be thunderstorms over which the satellite will fly . This means that whistlers will come into the VLF detector from below. The characteristics of whistlers depend on the properties of the lightning itself, together with the free electrons, ion density and the magnetic field in the ionosphere. The properties of the whistlers can be approximately explained by Appleton's equation, which expresses the phase refractive index for electromagnetic waves passing through magnetized plasma. In this case, it will be the Earth's ionosphere, due to ultraviolet radiation and X-rays coming from the Sun, which ionize upper parts of our atmosphere. Appleton's equation considers only the effects of free electrons and for more precise understanding of whistlers, free ions will need to be taken into consideration. Therefore, the analysis of whistlers will also bring new information about the ionosphere, which is ultimately important for any radio communication and position measurements between the Earth and satellites in space.

This level of flexibility requires the ability to accurately simulate, optimize and control the satellite once it is in orbit. Our customers will have their own software to implement the on-board configuration they require, while operators manage and operate the satellite in its optimal configuration without interference within the satellite or with other nearby satellites. 3) A new standard of customization The satellite’s flexible behavior enables it to adapt to its environment, giving customers in the government, mobility and data markets the ability to vary coverages based on their immediate needs and allocate resources between beams and regions, optimizing their capacity use. The majority of Eutelsat Quantum’s capacity has already been reserved, notably by American operator, Peraton, demonstrating the commercial interest in the satellite. While Eutelsat Quantum's flexibility in terms of coverage, power and spectrum reconfiguration is significant, its beam tracking and hopping capabilities extend its boundaries even further. Beam reconfiguration enables Eutelsat Quantum to track mobile terminals. For example, in the marine industry, a beam can now be reconfigured to seamlessly track the progress of a terminal across an ocean, without having to lease multiple beams to cover the relevant regions. 4) A forerunner in tomorrow's space industry Eutelsat Quantum is leading the way for a paradigm shift in building telecommunications satellites. Taking inspiration from Eutelsat Quantum, satellites built according to a standard specification and configured in orbit could be mass produced, unlike the custom-made production of traditional satellites, which are configured during"

L. U., an Elecnor company of Boecillo, Spain. The Deimos-2 mission is aimed at operating an agile minisatellite for high-resolution EO (Earth Observation) applications. The agile spacecraft can be steered to accurately point the pushbroom-type optical payload, which can provide 1 m panchromatic and 4 m multispectral images in a swath of 12 km at nadir, at an orbit altitude of ~600 km. The multispectral capability includes 4 channels in the visible and near-infrared spectral range (red, green, blue and NIR). The off-nadir tilting capability of the S/C is intended to improve the revisit time performance and enhance the operational flexibility by significantly reducing the time interval to take images on areas of interest. While the across-track tilt angle for nominal image acquisitions is ±30º, the satellite can be configured to achieve ±45º off-nadir pointing capability, i.e., an extended FOR (Field of Regard) for data collection with short revisit times in emergency situations. Moreover, high-quality observations can be performed close to nadir (small FOR) to enable background mapping. Spacecraft: A contract between Deimos Imaging Inc. of Valladolid, Spain and SI (Satrec Initiative) of Daejeon, Korea was signed in November 2010. The satellite and its payload are being designed and developed by SI. According to agreements, the spacecraft will be integrated and tested in Spain in collaboration with SI, in the new Elecnor Deimos Satellite Systems premises at Boecillo near"

Deimos Satellite Systems is responsible for system engineering, procurement, testing, integration, launcher procurement, commissioning, in-flight acceptance, and operations of the system. The project PDR (Preliminary Design Review) was in May 2011. The CDR (Critical Design Review) was completed in June of 2012. The spacecraft bus is designed to fulfil all mission requirements by incorporating 3-axis stabilized, accurate and agile attitude control for precise imaging operations. The satellite attitude is based on the following main nominal operations modes (Ref. 1): • Housekeeping sun-pointing mode in sunlight: During the sunlight stage, the spacecraft attitude shall be maintained or steered so that the solar panels are always pointing towards the sun for maximum power generation. When the spacecraft is in sunlight, the camera points in the direction opposite to the sun, unless it is in observation mode. • Housekeeping nadir-pointing mode in eclipse: The S/C shall point towards the Earth during eclipse to minimize the usage of payload heaters. When the S/C is in eclipse, the camera points in the nadir direction. • EO modes: The platform agility is exploited to take images not only close to nadir, but also with up to ±45º into any direction (cross-track or ±30º along-track). This allows single-strip imaging of areas of interest, multi-pointing imaging of close-enough targets, single-pass stereo imaging by along-track pitch angle maneuvers and tessellation imaging. Note: In geometrical terminology a tessellation is the pattern resulting from the arrangement of regular polygons to cover a plane without any interstices (gaps) or overlapping. The patterns are usually repeating. • Data"

At the same time, the X-band antenna gimbal shall be steered towards the GS antenna to provide the needed gain. Consecutive image download operations are foreseen if the single-GS pass duration is not sufficient for data download and the following GS visibility interval is very close to the previous one. • Orbit maintenance and control operation mode: In-plane and out-of-plane orbit maneuvers are enabled by setting firing attitude parameters. Spacecraft: The Deimos-2 spacecraft is identical to the DubaiSat-1 minisatellite (launched on Nov. 21, 2013) except for a battery capacity to account for a longer life. The nominal mission lifetime shall be 7 years, with a goal of 10 years. Deimos-2 features the SpaceEye-1 platform of SI (Satrec Initiative), a 300 kg class minisatellite bus (also referred to as SI-300). The SI-300 bus is of DubaiSat-2 heritage. Its architecture is designed to accommodate an Earth observation and/or science payload. The HEPS (Hall Effect Propulsion System) is installed for orbit control and maintenance. Accurate and agile three-axis attitude control supports precise imaging operations. Dual redundancies are adapted where necessary in the system architecture design to increase reliability of the satellite system. The SI-300 platform, whose size is 1.5 m in diameter and 1.95 m in height, features a deck-and-longeron type structure permitting easy assembly and disassembly.

AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem): The AOCS provides satellite pointing capability for single-strip, multi-strip and single-pass stereo imaging. Five reaction wheels are used for attitude control along with four Fiber Optic Gyros. Attitude data is provided by Star Trackers for fine-pointing and magnetometers and sun sensors for coarse pointing in safe and acquisition mode. Deimos-2 has a pointing accuracy of 0.03º on all axes. A key-feature of the satellite is a high-agility to allow fast body-pointing of up to 45º off nadir, however, during nominal operations off-nadir angles of up to 30º will be used. Propulsion subsystem: A HEPS (Hall Effect Propulsion System) is used for orbit maintenance and orbit adjustments. It uses electric propulsion utilizing Xenon gas and a microwave cathode. HEPS consists of a XFU (Xenon Fuel Unit), THU (Thruster Head Unit), PPU (Power Processing Unit) and the MCU (Microwave Cathode Unit). The XFU holds about 2 kg of Xenon fuel that is held at a pressure of 150 bar. Via pressure valves and orifices, Xenon is allowed to flow into two smaller tanks, each at 3 bar for the anode and cathode. The thruster head includes magnets for ion motion detection while the PPU provides the different voltages for the HEPS system to accelerate generated Xenon ions to high velocity for ejection.

The proven design has a significant heritage with DubaiSat-1 and -2 of EIAST (Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology), United Arab Emirates. Dubaisat-2 is an almost exact Deimos-2 twin. The HiRAIS instrument consists of three elements: • EOS (Electro-Optical Subsystem) • SSRU (Solid-State Recorder Unit) • ITU (Image Transmission Unit). EOS is comprised of the following elements: telescope, ACM (Auxiliary Camera Module), and FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). EOS is a pushbroom type camera with 1 m GSD (Ground Sampling Distance) for a panchromatic imagery and 4 m GSD in four MS (Multispectral) bands (red, green, blue and NIR). The swath width of the generated image is 12 km. EOS features a Korsch telescope with 5 mirrors. The optical design includes the main mirror (M1) of 415 mm diameter, 3 mirrors to increase the focal length up to 5.7 m, and a flat mirror to reflect light rays onto FPA. Light-weighted Zerodur is used for the mirrors, while CFRP material was used to design the main optomechanical structure of HiRAIS. The temperature balance of the mirror surfaces, the distances between the mirrors and the FPA are all actively controlled by a feedback heating system, which includes thermostats and heaters. Also passive cooling with heat dissipative materials.

Ground segment: The ground segment has been completely developed in-house by Elecnor Deimos Space, in Madrid. Deimos Imaging (DMI), a company of the Elecnor Deimos Group, will be operating the Deimos-2 mission from its premises in Spain. The link between the space and ground segments will be performed thanks to the main GS (Ground Station) Puertollano (Spain) for both telemetry and telecommand and payload data (10 m antenna dish), and optionally to the GS of Svalbard (Norway) for payload data download only. Deimos ground segments are based on the gs4EO (Ground Segment for Earth Observation) suite of state-of-the-art products. These products are the result of the know-how gathered for more than a decade of work for ESA (European Space Agency), customized to small Earth Observation missions. gs4EO flight operations software has been designed according to the following main drivers: • Operations automation, enabling the complete handling of all the S/C operations with the minimum number of operators and maintenance costs.

Exploitation of wide spread secured web technologies will allow distributed flight operations • Quick response to emergency operations, allowing reprogramming the satellite operations in a very short time, even changing the on-board operations within the same orbit (e.g. to schedule an emergency acquisition and to download it in the same orbit). • Deployment flexibility, allowing installing the ground systems in different locations and using different sets of ground stations, both for spacecraft monitoring and control and payload data reception. It allows to install independent spacecraft control or payload data processing systems or even individual facilities (e.g. mission planning). • Expandability: gs4EO is a modular system allowing an easy adaptation of its capabilities to future needs (e.g. collaboration with other satellite service providers). • Based on open platforms that minimize licensing costs and facilitate interoperability and maintainability. • Maximize interoperability, aligning with international standards whenever possible.

It is to be noted that nearly all the GS infrastructure is running in a virtualized HW environment. Archive & catalog, as well as data processing servers are easily scalable in this framework. Two main chain are identified in the ground segment: 1) the flight operations chain, and 2) the data processing chain. In both chains the user services element is involved, either as initiator or as final destination of the chain. Flight operations chain: The gs4EO FOS (Flight Operations Segment) addresses one of the main challenges for small commercial missions, the reduction of operations costs. One of the main costs drivers for commercial missions that required uninterrupted exploitation of the S/C payload, is the amount of operators required in the control center during working and non working hours to perform operations tasks or even to supervise that ongoing operations are performed according to plan. This is critical to prevent any unforeseen stop on the mission data return. For this reason it is important for small commercial missions to reduce to a minimum the amount of man power required to operate the S/C but ensuring the maximum mission return. The gs4EO FOS addresses this critical aspect by two key features: • Automation of nominal operations • Grant secured access to Control Center functions from remote sites. The GS4EO FOS provides the auto4EO component, a powerful automation infrastructure that allows all nominal satellite operations to be performed without operator intervention. All gs4EO FOS components export their functions via"

Those APIs can be called from scripts to access those functions, in a similar way that the operator works via the component HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces). Using the various APIs , scripts can be implemented to automate all required tasks related to satellite operations. Scripts could, in principle, be implemented in any available scripting language, though for the gs4EO, support is provided only for a number of them that are of common use by the computing community such Python, Ruby and Javascript. Satellite operations related activities (as scripts) can be scheduled for execution by an operator, or even by other gs4EO FOS component within the auto4EO infrastructure as required. Scheduled scripts can then be triggered by time or even by the occurrence of predetermined operational events (e.g. AOS, LOS, etc). This makes the gs4EO FOS automation environment very dynamic, where the system can react to whatever occurs as result of the operations activity execution. Data processing chain: The data processing function has been designed to operate automatically and in near-real time. Several levels of processing have been defined, from the stream of raw data produced by the instrument up to fully annotated, ortho-geolocated images of standard size. Two independent processing chains are defined: • The radiometric processing chain, which translates the instrument counts to scientific units (radiances). This chain relies on specific auxiliary information provided by the instrument, and on a calibration and characterization data base that must be updated regularly during the mission lifetime. • The geometric processing chain, which"

Other product derivatives, such as pan-sharpened images, three-dimensional scenes, and domain-specific products, are also supported as higher level processing levels. Multi-temporal analysis tools and methods, especially in the field of environmental monitoring, are a strong asset at Deimos. Although the processing chain integrates well-known transformations that are generally applicable to most optical missions, the specificities of the Deimos-2 mission have been taken into account when selecting between alternative algorithms. In addition, the modular design has made it possible that for some of the processing steps, more than one alternative module is provided. For example, the geolocation and ortho-rectification can be accomplished by using either a physical sensor model, or a RFM (Rational Function Model). Performance considerations will be used to select the best configuration during the commissioning phase of the mission. Notwithstanding the system's capability to automatically ortho-rectify the product images, Deimos' ground segment also supports human-driven ortho-rectification. In this approach, a human operator manually identifies ground control points in both the acquired image and a reference image, using tools specifically designed for this purpose. In the context of the Deimos-1 mission, this approach has shown to be more reliable and to achieve better accuracy than the fully automatic chain. The data processing chain incorporates different standards such as: • Catalog Web services following OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standards • EO GML meta data for products • OGC WPS for cluster distributed processing • ESA's Generic Interface for"

CAMP (Capacity Analysis and Mission Planning): CAMP is an automated operational mission planning tool optimized for agile satellites; it provides both enhanced long-term mission return analyses and a sound prototype for a fully-automated mission planning chain, working on short-term operational horizons. The CAMP tool is constructed around two main modules (Figure 35). On top of the inputs shown on the diagram (orange blocks), both modules share a wide set of inputs describing the orbit, the ground segment and the 3 modelled platform resources: AOCS, power and data handling. The first module generates feasible MTLs (Mission Timelines, sequence of operations). From a set of AoI (Areas of Interest), it analyses the orbital geometry to find observation opportunities and builds full MTLs that respect the constraints imposed by the system resources (modelled with some approximations). It is also able to repeat the scheduling exercise and select the best-performing MTL from the point of view of mission return (taking also cloud forecast into account). Finally, it provides results and plots about the coverage performance of the selected MTL over the simulation time. The second module simulates the execution of the selected MTL by the spacecraft, thanks to a high-fidelity system simulator. It combines the MTL and the high-fidelity orbit propagation (based on operational orbit determination) to derive the pointing angles to be uploaded to the satellite. It then uses state-of-the-art models to simulate the AOCS, the power management and the data flow. It produces a thorough reporting of the satellite system state at"

An MTL coming from the MTL generator has no reason to create any conflict under nominal conditions, as it uses fair models of the on board resources plus security margins. But unexpected changes in the MTL (operator manual edit for contingency reasons) or in the orbit (emergency maneuvers) might overload the system. This final crosscheck is critical for the security of the system. Automated mission timeline generation: The tool receives as input the users' requests, represented by AoIs (Areas of Interest), and transforms them into targets. Through a geometric analysis, involving the propagated satellite orbit, the targets' position and some user defined constraints (including cloud coverage forecast) all the possible observation events are selected. They are ordered by priority and then passed to a scheduler that, thanks to approximate models of the satellite resources, generates a mission timeline satisfying the platform constraints. The MTL performance is evaluated by means of a FoM (Figure of Merit) and the ordering and scheduling process can be repeated in order to maximize the mission return. The architecture of the automated mission timeline generator is shown in Figure 36."

Virtualization enables scaling up and down of applications by elastic on-demand provisioning of VMs in response to their variable load to achieve increased utilization efficiency at a lower operational cost, while guaranteeing the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS, such as response time) to the end-users.

If the functional description includes only one task, this optimization would generate a single task-focused microservice without having to re-engineer the complete software from ""bottom-up"" into smaller modules. One further consideration on this project regards system scalability. The Use Cases for testing the ENTICE technology, i.e. Land Management, Infrastructure Monitoring and Disaster Response are designed for scaling the three main parts of the system (respectively Storage, Processing and Distribution) and having to response to variable data demand scenarios.

To overcome this, deep space missions have traditionally used large antennas mounted to large spacecraft. Then Jet Propulsion Laboratory's MarCO (Mars Cube One) 6U CubeSat demonstrated it was possible to downsize the spacecraft and still close the deep space communications link. On the ground side, NASA-funded deep space missions have relied on the DSN (Deep Space Network). DSN has high gain antennas at three points on the globe with approximately 120 degrees of longitude separation from each other. This means deep space missions using DSN are in view of at least one antenna at all times. However, there are two problems with DSN for non-governmental missions. The first is cost. Compatibility testing alone runs in the range of $40,000 to $50,000. Then there is an additional cost for aperture time once the mission is underway. The second problem is demand. The increasing sophistication of scientific instruments on deep space missions has led to an increase in demand for DSN's services. According to JPL's Office of the Chief Scientist and Chief Technologist, ""NASA estimates that the deep space communications capability will need to grow by nearly a factor of 10 each of the next three decades.""

While ATLAS does not have the same level of coverage as the Deep Space Network, it does have access to a worldwide network of antennas with the capability to transmit to and receive signals from deep space. CU-E3's communications window will be limited to the time when the ATLAS ground station is in view. For our current launch date and ground station antenna in Brewster, Washington, we estimate the communications window to be approximately six hours at the beginning of the mission. That time will change over the course of the mission, ranging from 5 to 9 hours across the length of the mission. Additionally, if the launch date changes, the Artemis-1 SLS and CU-E3 trajectory will change, affecting the length of the communications window. Balancing all these factors to produce a communications plan for the mission will be a critical part of the mission going forward. In addition to the limitations on transmit time imposed by the communications window, there are two other technical factors limiting the transmit time: 1) heat dissipation from the transmitter and high-power amplifier. Results from current testing and analysis allow for the maximum transmission time to be estimated as approximately four hours. 2) desaturation of the reaction wheels. As CU-E3 lacks a propulsion system, the reaction wheels cannot be quickly desaturated. Therefore, throughout the mission the satellite will have to rotate into a desaturation attitude that uses solar radiation pressure to slowly decrease the stored reaction wheel momentum. The"

However, documentation quality varies, and even when documentation is well-written, understanding it often requires incoming students to have a level of knowledge they do not yet possess. The effects of student turnover are limited by retaining upper level graduate students in project management rolls after their completion of the two-semester course, who can then serve as sources of reference on previously completed work. Additionally, finding students to work on the communications subsystem of CU-E3 poses a particular challenge. While CU Boulder does have a strong program in radio frequency (RF) engineering, most of the students in that program are PhD students who are committed to projects in the electrical engineering department. Hence, they are not available to work on CU-E3. A related problem is making a match between what the project needs to have done (for example, antenna design and digital communications) and skills that students available to work on the project have. Because CU Boulder's electrical engineering program does not specialize in digital communications, students must learn ""on the job"" while working on CU-E3's communications system. A high level of selfmotivation and willingness to seek out resources is required. Some technical challenges have been created"

For example, the team looked at purchasing a C-band patch array antenna. Such components typically cost several thousand dollars, and the project did not have the budget for that purchase. Consequently, that part became part of the student-designed hardware. After eighteen months of development, the team found that the students' design was too thick to be manufactured. This necessitated a redesign after the original students involved in the antenna project had left. This caused a significant delay in the production and testing of that part, and represents the difficulty."

CU-E3 is different in that we will be using two separate ground systems. The NASA competition we are participating in requires that we use the DSN (Deep Space Network) for ranging. For budget reasons, CU-E3 needed to find another provider for telemetry and command services. The team conducted research on potential ground station partners at the 2017 SmallSat conference. After team member John Sobtzak presented a poster on the CU-E3 communications system at the conference, the team was approached by the University of Alaska Fairbanks about working with them for ground station support. CU-E3 also talked with ATLAS Space Operations at the SmallSat conference. ATLAS buys time on antennas around the world, and serves as an aperture time broker service. Antennas in the ATLAS network have transmit and receive capabilities at various frequencies, including the C-band uplink and X-band downlink capability that CU-E3 needs for its mission. Users access the antenna network using ATLAS's FreedomTM platform. ATLAS is also developing a second service, the LINKSTM electronically steered array system. This system achieves the power provided by a 70 m parabolic dish antenna. The LINKSTM system is the basis of the Interplanetary Satellite Communications Network (ISCN), which can track and communicate with satellites operating up to 18 million kilometers from Earth using VHF, UHF, S-band, and X-band frequencies.

Lucy’s complex path will take it to both clusters of Trojans and give us our first close-up view of all three major types of bodies in the swarms (so-called C-, P- and D-types). The dark-red P- and D-type Trojans resemble those found in the Kuiper Belt of icy bodies that extends beyond the orbit of Neptune. The C-types are found mostly in the outer parts of the Main Belt of asteroids, between Mars and Jupiter. All of the Trojans are thought to be abundant in dark carbon compounds.

Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids, which orbit the Sun on the same path as the gas giant, are no exception. The Trojans are thought to be left over from the objects that eventually formed our planets, and studying them might offer clues about how the solar system came to be. - Over the next 12 years, NASA’s Lucy mission will visit eight asteroids — including seven Trojans — to help answer big questions about planet formation and the origins of our solar system. It will take the spacecraft about three and a half years to reach its first destination. What might Lucy find? - Like all the planets, asteroids exist in the heliosphere, the vast bubble of space defined by the reaches of our Sun’s wind. Directly and indirectly, the Sun affects many aspects of existence within this pocket of the universe. Here are a few of the ways the Sun influences asteroids like the Trojans in our solar system. Place in Space - The Sun makes up 99.8% of the solar system’s mass and exerts a strong gravitational force as a result. In the case of the Trojan asteroids that Lucy will visit, their very location in space is dictated in part by the Sun’s gravity. They are clustered at two Lagrange points. These are locations where the gravitational forces of two massive objects — in this case the Sun and Jupiter — are balanced in such a way that smaller objects"

The Trojans lead and follow Jupiter in its orbit by 60° at Lagrange points L4 and L5. Pushing Asteroids Around (with Light!) - That’s right, sunlight can move asteroids! Like Earth and many other objects in space, asteroids rotate. At any given moment, the Sun-facing side of an asteroid absorbs sunlight while the dark side sheds energy as heat. When the heat escapes, it creates an infinitesimal amount of thrust, pushing the asteroid ever so slightly off its course. Over millions of years, this force, called the Yarkovsky effect, can noticeably alter the trajectory of smaller asteroids (those less than 25 miles, or about 40 km, in diameter). - Similarly, sunlight can also alter the rotation rate of small asteroids. This effect, known as YORP (named for four scientists whose work contributed to the discovery), affects asteroids in different ways depending on their size, shape, and other characteristics. Sometimes, YORP causes small bodies to spin faster until they break apart. Other times, it may cause their rotation rates to slow. - The Trojans are farther from the Sun than the near-Earth or Main Belt asteroids we’ve studied before, and it remains to be seen how the Yarkovsky effect and YORP affect them. Shaping the Surface - Just like rocks on Earth show signs of weathering, so too do rocks in space, including asteroids. When rocks warm up during the day, they expand. As they cool down, they contract. Over time, this fluctuation causes cracks to"

The phenomenon is more intense on objects without atmospheres, such as asteroids, where temperatures vary wildly. Therefore, even though the Trojans are farther from the Sun than rocks on Earth, they’ll likely show more signs of thermal fracturing. - The lack of atmosphere has another implication for asteroid weathering: Asteroids are battered by the solar wind, a steady stream of particles, magnetic fields, and radiation that flows from the Sun. For the most part, Earth’s magnetic field protects us from this bombardment. Particles that do get through can excite molecules in Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in auroras. Without magnetic fields or atmospheres of their own, asteroids receive the brunt of the solar wind. When incoming particles strike an asteroid, they can kick some material off into space, changing the fundamental chemistry of what’s left behind. • September 15, 2021: Discover the mysteries of the solar system through the eyes of the Lucy mission and its team members.

As these never before explored asteroids are in many ways “fossils” from the formation and evolution of the planets, the Lucy spacecraft is named in honor of the fossilized human ancestor discovered the year after Pioneer 11 began its journey out of the Solar System. Lucy’s name was inspired by the Beatles’ song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” - After Lucy finishes visiting a record number of asteroids for a single mission in 2033 (8 asteroids on 6 independent orbits around the Sun) the Lucy spacecraft will continue to travel between the Trojan asteroids and the orbit of the Earth for at least hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. It is easy to imagine that someday in the distant future our descendants will find Lucy floating among the planets.

Without searching for these asteroid companions before launch, Lucy could also run the risk of encountering an unexpected binary pair. Seeing two asteroids when the spacecraft is expecting only one could confuse its autonomous tracking system. - Fortunately, the Lucy science team is already familiar with the perfect tool to use. “One of the ways that you can try to look for satellites is to use Hubble. And that’s something that I’ve done a lot with the Kuiper Belt,” says Keith Noll, the mission’s project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and one of the discoverers of Eurybates’ satellite. “We know more than 100 binaries in the Kuiper Belt, and the vast majority of those were found with Hubble.” - And understandably so. The orbiting telescope, 13.3 meters long, which has a primary mirror with a diameter of 2.4 meters, is unencumbered by the normal blurring effects of Earth’s atmosphere, since it resides comfortably above the atmosphere. Though some of the larger earthbound telescopes are sometimes able to observe the heavens with similar clarity, Hubble can detect a small, dim satellite orbiting very close to a larger, brighter asteroid that a telescope on Earth might miss. - To know where to look for"

The Hill sphere is an imaginary sphere around a body, inside of which the body has the dominant gravitational influence. In other words, all stable satellites of a body orbit within its Hill sphere. Earth’s Hill sphere, for instance, has a radius of nearly 1.5 million km (930,000 miles), and the Moon orbits safely inside at approximately 380,000 km (236,000 miles). - Noll’s team submitted a proposal to use Hubble to search for satellites and made their first round of observations in the fall of 2018. They then scoured the images for evidence of satellites. This process is difficult, since raw images from Hubble can be messy. “It’s got a lot of bumps and blobs, it’s not a clean thing,” remarks Noll. For instance, raw images of bright objects often show diffraction spikes, the bright X-shapes that resemble cartoon four-pointed stars. Hubble’s cameras are also susceptible to cosmic rays (particles traveling at close to the speed of light) which can appear as bright dots on the images. “So when you look at [the images], you say, ‘Well, is that blob a satellite, or is it just part of… the way that the light gets scattered from the entire optical assembly throughout the telescope?’” Except for a brief false alarm when it appeared that another Lucy target, Orus, might be a binary, the team saw no new evidence of satellites. - That is, until November 2019.

In looking for photos to demonstrate the difficulties of distinguishing between satellites and other bright blobs, he came across one of his team’s Hubble photos from Sept. 12, 2018. After experimenting with the brightness and contrast, he saw one peculiar bright spot near Eurybates. “I said, ‘Gosh, that one really looks like what I would expect a satellite to look like.’” Realizing it was getting late, he circled the object and finished making the presentation. In his talk the next day, he pointed out the object’s striking resemblance to a satellite. In the audience was Mike Brown, one of the mission’s science co-investigators. Brown interrupted to ask Noll if he had looked at the data from the other observation on Sept. 14, but Noll admitted that he had not had a chance yet. According to Noll, before he finished presenting, Brown examined the data from Sept. 14 and exclaimed, “I see it there too!” - Everyone crowded around Brown’s laptop. Had they actually discovered a satellite of Eurybates? The team noticed that as they compared the two photos, the object appeared to have moved a little, like a satellite might. A check revealed that the object’s observed positions fit many possible orbits. From a planetary dynamics perspective, it also made sense that Eurybates might have a satellite. Eurybates is one of a massive set of fragments created by the same asteroid collision, so the idea that one of these fragments might be orbiting"

These were all steps in the right direction, but not conclusive evidence. The team had only two observations so far, and according to Noll, “You never really believe anything until you’ve seen it the third time, so we had to get more data.” They submitted an urgent proposal to use Hubble again, which was approved quickly enough that the team was able to get their observations about a month later. They requested 12 chances to observe the satellite, but they were granted three. If they could see the satellite again on at least one of the three, they would be given the other nine. - Their first chance was on Dec. 11. The satellite was a no-show. The team wasn’t worried – yet – because they knew there was a good chance that it might be simply too close to Eurybates, and lost in the glare. They tried a second time on Dec. 21, but much to their consternation, the shy little rock was nowhere to be found. The team began to doubt that their so-called satellite even existed. “Maybe we’re just kidding ourselves. Maybe it’s not real,” Noll remembers thinking. - Finally, on Jan. 3, they found it. The tiny, dim satellite was clearly visible on the new images. As they’d suspected, in the previous two observations it was too close to Eurybates (which is over 6,000 times brighter than its companion) to be seen. The difference in brightness suggests that the satellite is probably less than 1 km in diameter,"

However, the asteroids emerged from behind the Sun in July 2020, and since then, the Lucy team has been able to observe the satellite with Hubble on multiple occasions, allowing the team to precisely define the satellite’s orbit and allowing the little satellite to finally get an official name – Queta. - Queta is the first Trojan asteroid named under a newly revised naming convention for Trojan asteroids. Though the Trojans were previously only named for heroes from Homer’s Iliad, smaller Trojans are now named after Olympic and Paralympic athletes, in recognition of these modern day heroes. Queta is named in honor of Mexican track and field athlete Norma Enriqueta “Queta” Basilio Sotelo. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, she became the first woman in history to light the Olympic cauldron. The name “Queta” was selected for Eurybates’ satellite because Basilio’s role is similar to that of Eurybates, a Greek herald. In ancient Greece, heralds were messengers in the service of kings or governments, an occupation that sometimes involved running long distances. According to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, a herald named Pheidippides ran 260 km from Athens to Sparta to request the Spartans’ aid in the Battle of Marathon. (It is from this legend that we get the word “marathon.”) Heralds were also tasked with announcing the start of the ancient Olympic Games, similar to how"

The arrays are designed to unfurl like fans and latch into place. While one array, called -Y, did completely unfurl and latch, the other, +Y, did not latch into place. - “People have been working day and night since the launch to try and figure out what’s going on, and I think we understand it,” Levison said. The +Y array, rather than unfurling a full 360 degrees, instead went 347 degrees. In that configuration, the spacecraft is still generating more than 90% of its expected power. “Power is not an issue for the spacecraft, nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.” - The arrays unfurl when a motor pulls on a lanyard, swinging one end of the array around and into place. Levison said that the most likely reason the array did not latch"
0,Lucyeoportal directory,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/l/lucy,EoPortal,EoPortal,Mission status 3,"is that, for some reason, there was a loss of tension in the lanyard during deployment. That caused it to fall off a spool and wrap around the motor shaft. About 75 centimeters of lanyard remains to be pulled in. - “It matches the data really well, so we have really high confidence this is true,” he said. One possible cause of the loss of tension, he added, is a “dynamic interaction” between the two arrays during the deployment. - Mission managers are considering two alternatives. One is to turn the motors back on and try to bring in the remaining lanyard segment so that the array can lock into place. “We’re almost there, so I think if we can pull a little harder, we might be able to get it to latch,” he said. The motor can pull harder, he said, but engineers want to assess the risks of doing so before making another attempt. - The other option is to keep the array as is. While the array can generate enough power without being fully deployed, Levison said engineers want to study its integrity in that configuration during main engine burns. “The analysis so far is looking good. We should be able to do at least some of the main engine burns we’re planning.” - There’s no rush to decide whether to redeploy the array or leave it as is. “We have plenty of time because we’re not scheduled to fire the main engine for a while,” he said. “We’re taking our time to"

Yet the data gathered in those few seconds will contribute to the success of NASA’s Lucy mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Oct. 16. - The star appeared to briefly blink out because the asteroid Eurybates had passed in front of it. Eurybates is one of a handful of asteroids Lucy will visit over the next 12 years. - As Eurybates eclipsed the star, a phenomenon scientists call an “occultation,” a 40-mile- (64-kilometer-) wide shadow the size of the asteroid passed over the region. By spreading out inside the shadow’s predicted path across Nevada, astronomers sought to measure the width of Eurybates down to several hundred feet, or a couple hundred meters, and to ascertain its shape.

Why Occultations? - An occultation is any event where one celestial object passes in front of another, blocking the latter object from an observer’s view. The best-known example is a solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun from our view. - “It really does look like a star just vanished,” said Marc Buie, occultation science lead for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. Buie helped coordinate the Eurybates observations in Nevada. “It’s kind of a weird thing to see, but an occultation gives us really valuable information.” - Observing occultations is one of the tools scientists have for gathering precise information about the size and shape of Lucy’s target destinations, known as “Trojan” asteroids. These Trojans are clustered in two swarms that orbit the Sun at about the same distance as Jupiter (though they’re as far away from Jupiter as they are from the Sun). Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early solar system, with the largest ones named after characters from Greek mythology. The Lucy mission, for the first time, will analyze seven of them up close, helping scientists hone the theory of how the planets formed and ended up in their current locations. - While scientists can spot Trojan asteroids using powerful observatories such as NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope (and in fact discovered a moon of Eurybates this way in 2018), the asteroids appear only as small points of light, so it’s challenging to"
0,Lucyeoportal directory,https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/l/lucy,EoPortal,EoPortal,Mission status 7,"precisely determine their true sizes and shapes. - “Occultations are one way for us to learn as much as we can about the objects before Lucy gets there, so that we can make the most of the brief opportunity we’ll get when the spacecraft is super close to each target,” said Brian Keeney, an occultation specialist for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute. - After Lucy reaches each asteroid, scientists will be able to measure each asteroid’s mass. That information, combined with size and shape data from flybys, occultations, and other Earth-based techniques, will help reveal the density of each asteroid. Density tells scientists about composition, or whether an asteroid is made mostly of ice or of rock. Scientists hope to compare the compositions of the Trojan asteroids to figure out if they came from the same or different parts of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, and how the Trojans relate to other asteroids in the solar system. - “Lucy will see each asteroid’s surface, but we need to learn more about the interior, which is where occultations can help,” Keeney said. Watching a Star Disappear - To prepare for an occultation, astronomers predict a shadow’s path across Earth, based on the known orbit of the asteroid and the precise position of the star to be occulted. Then they set up dozens of telescopes along a line perpendicular to that path and wait for the asteroid to eclipse a specific star. They count the seconds that starlight blinks out as the"

By observing multiple occultations of the same asteroid, scientists can catch different sides of the asteroid and combine their two-dimensional silhouette projections into a three-dimensional shape model. - “Occultations have proven to be an excellent technique to maximize the science return of missions such as Lucy,” said Adriana Ocampo, program executive for the Lucy mission based at NASA Headquarters in Washington. - Accurate predictions of future occultation times and locations rely on impeccable information related to star and asteroid locations. When Buie started tracking occultations in the 1980s, the data available left him with huge areas of uncertainty, meaning his team could end up miles outside an asteroid’s shadow. To catch an occultation of a 10-mile- (20-kilometer-) wide asteroid, for instance, Buie would have spread telescopes out along a 190-mile (300-kilometer) path.

In Nevada, for instance, professional and amateur astronomers from across the country, including teachers and high school students, used 37 telescopes to observe Eurybates. - But occultations happen all over world, from Argentina to South Africa, Senegal and Spain. Buie and other Lucy scientists must coordinate travel to these destinations, find observation volunteers locally, and train them. - “Occultations provide an important international collaborative factor of scientific advancement for the good of humanity, excitement, engagement and inspiration which is at the core of NASA’s mission,” said Ocampo, who participates in observation campaigns. - On top of the logistical challenges of organizing occultation campaigns, scientists must contend with unpredictable weather. Successful campaigns depend on clear skies. As observers waited for Eurybates occultation in Nevada, they saw clouds moving toward them. - “If that Eurybates occultation had been an hour later, nobody would’ve seen anything,” Buie said. “The clouds would have wiped us out.” - The team will continue to observe occultations until Lucy's last flyby of Trojan asteroid Patroclus in 2033, even in the face of bad weather. - To learn about how Lucy's complex and unique trajectory was designed and the big solar system questions the mission will help answer, check out: NASA's Lucy Mission: A Journey to the Young Solar System. • October 17, 2021: Engineers are investigating why one of the two solar arrays on NASA’s"

However, when flying by the Trojan asteroids that are the destination of the mission, the arrays will produce only 500 watts of power, still sufficient to operate the spacecraft and its three main instruments. - She added there was no specific design requirement for circular arrays versus more conventional rectangular ones, but that those offered the most area while fitting in the confines of the Atlas payload fairing. “This particular design really enables us to stow up closely and tightly next to the spacecraft for launch,” she said. “Having any particular shape other than this really unique design wouldn’t enable us to get to that 51-meter-squared of active cell area and still fit within the launch vehicle fairing.”"

The purpose of the project is to perform a technology demonstration of a new patented instrument; the multiple-Needle-Langmuir Probe (m-NLP). The instrument is designed to be able to perform electron density measurements with high spatial resolution. During solar storms, turbulent electron clouds are formed in the ionosphere, causing strong coherent backscatter echos and scintillations in the ionosphere above the polar regions. The phenomenon of electron clouds are far from fully understood. Research in this area gives us the knowledge that we can later use to notify space weather, and to improve equipment such as GPS receivers. CubeSTAR will measure and quantify the structures in the electron clouds and improve the resolution 2000-fold, from today’s seven kilometers down to the meter level. The CubeSTAR project is motivated by both academic and scientific goals. The academic objective is to recruit students to the space science and technology sector. Students are actively involved in the project through graduate theses, participation in international conferences and other activities. This allows the students to take part in a real space mission.

The project is partly funded by NSC (Norwegian Space Center), through ANSAT (Norwegian Student Satellite Program), and NAROM (Norwegian Center for Space-related Education), and by industry. Spacecraft: A 2U CubeSat form factor is being used for the spacecraft design developed by students of the University of Oslo. The nanosatellite has a size of 20 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and a mass of ≤ 2kg. One of the major goals for the project is to build and develop most of the systems in house. This introduces several interesting masters projects that together will have a final goal. The satellite is built and developed by university students along with the electronics lab and the mechanical workshop which will provide the satellite structure and support the students with production of the electronic systems.

The requirements call for for an attitude pointing control of < ±10º along the pitch and yaw axis to perform undisturbed scientific measurements. Attitude sensing is provided sun sensors, gyroscopes (3 axes) and magnetometers (3 axes).Attitude determination is performed using a simplified Kalman filter to process the sensor outputs using a high speed controller to perform the calculations.

Detumbling: Detumbling is the process of stabilizing the angular rate of the satellite after orbital insertion. The system uses a B-dot algorithm to detumble. The principle of the B-dot algorithm is to reduce and minimize the derivative of the angular rate. The B-dot controller uses magnetometers to derive the angular rates and manipulate the actuator coils to reduce the angular rate. Inner structure of CubeSTAR: The internal subsystems are built as electronic cards, which can be inserted into the satellite structure and connected to the satellite electrically through bus connectors mounted on a backbone bus card. The backbone bus card interfaces the subsystems through an internal bus, providing a power bus, signal lines and an I2C communication bus for the internal systems to communicate with each other. EPS (Electric Power Subsystem): Use of UTJ (Ultra Triple Junction) solar cells of Spectrolab with an efficiency of ~ 28%. The average power generation during the sunlit portion of the orbit is ~4W. The power from the solar panels is regulated using a MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker). The regulator monitors the I-V curve of the solar panels and converts the voltage from the solar panels down to an appropriate charging voltage for the batteries. Two 4.4 Ah LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) battery packs from A123 Systems Inc. are chosen for the mission. These batteries were selected due to their thermal and chemical stability compared to lithium-ion batteries. The drawback"

Power bus: The EPS supplies a constant 3 V bus to the satellite subsystems. The bus is voltage regulated, with current limiting sensors to protect the batteries from abuse by the subsystems. It was chosen for this mission to only provide a 3 V bus because the discharge voltage for the LiFePO4 batteries is ~3.25 V. OBC (On-Board Controller): Information will be provided when available. RF communications: The TT&C (Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem) operates in the UHF amateur satellite band (435-438 MHz), operating in a 25 kHz channel. The system has two radio links, a high-speed link and a low-speed link.. The high-speed link is a half duplex channel, capable of transmitting baud rates between 600 - 19200 baud, using the AX.25 packet protocol and the GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) modulation scheme. The AX.25 packet protocol is a well defined open standard used for transferring data in amateur radio networks. This protocol was selected because one of the requirements for using the amateur satellite bands is to use an open communication protocol. The link is designed for compatibility with GENSO (Global Educational Network for Satellite Operations). GENSO is a ground station network intended for use by the amateur satellite community. The network connects amateur ground station throughout the world through the internet, allowing amateur satellite teams to communicate with their satellite when the satellite is out of range from the local ground station.

The system was successfully flown on the ICI-2 (Investigation of Cusp Irregularities-2) sounding rocket payload launched from the Andoya Rocket Range on December 5, 2008. In addition, the concept has been verified in ESA's plasma chamber in April 2008. A low-power version, m-NLP, will be adapted to the CubeSTAR project to be the scientific payload onboard the satellite. Previous Langmuir probe systems have had a spatial resolution in the range of several km, while the multi-Needle Langmuir Probe system achieves a spatial resolution down to sub-meter scale. The system comprises four cylindrical probes of cylindrical shape with a diameter of 0.5 mm and a length of about 25 mm. Each probe is being operated at a different fixed bias voltage in the electron saturation region. Calculation of the electron density will be done on-board the spacecraft in an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA (Floating Point Gate Array), which also will handle the calculation of attitude determination and the control for other subsystems. Design advantages of the instrument: • Debye sheet effects can be ignored due to the small radius of the probe • Fixed bias voltage allows for sampling rates up to 9 kHz • Differential measurements remove the need for electron temperature (Te) • Electron density (Ne) becomes proportional to the electron current (Ie) Needle probes: The needle probes needed to have a very small diameter (about"

In order to reduce sheath effects, it is desirable to have the probes as small as possible, about 1/10 of the Debye shielding length. For prototyping, several semi-rigid coax cables of the probes were tested. The prototypes were made by using a scalpel to strip the coax cable, according to Figure 11. The center conductor of the coax cable, with a length of 25 mm, works as the cylindrical probe. The insulation on the remaining 15 mm of the braid was removed as well, in order to avoid charging of insulation material close to the probe. A very short insulation area was kept after the braid, in order to avoid a short-circuit between the braid and the center conductor. Other solutions were considered, but these made it inconvenient to get a good method for mechanical mounting and electrical contact. The solution with the semi-rigid coax cable was therefore chosen for its advantages for in-house production and short production time. The final decision was to use the Habia Flexiform 405 FJ. Electrical design of m-NPL: The m-NLP instrument contains two four-layer PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards); one DAQ (Data Acquisition Card) and one power/interface card.

The power/interface card performs voltage regulation and contains the communication interface to the rocket encoder. The two PCBs are connected together with card-to-card connectors made of two gold plated pin rows and mating connectors, giving a spacing of about 10 mm between the PCBs. Components are mainly SMDs (Surface Mounted Devices). They are smaller than hole mounted components and could contribute to lower noise a high frequencies. Some background on m-NPL measurements: In the northern regions the problem area is the auroral oval, and inside the entire polar cap, but the most important area of global interest is the equatorial region. Here the perturbations in the ionospheric plasma is caused by the force of gravity, instead of the force from the solar wind as in the polar regions. The global satellite communication (satcom) outage regions can be seen in Figure 13. In order to obtain a sufficient spatial resolution and a better understanding of ionospheric radio wave disturbances, in-situ measurements of the electron density in the space plasma have to be conducted. Langmuir probes are the best instrument for such measurements. To resolve the finest thinkable structures found in ionospheric plasma, limited by the electron gyro radius, a new high-speed sampling system was needed. Such a system can in a long perspective be of use in a global satellite network, mapping the structures and perturbations in the ionospheric plasma around the globe. This can result in a contribution to a space weather forecast for positioning and communication satellites. They suffer from scintillation (amplitude and phase"

The antenna rig is situated on the roof of the faculty building of UiO. The ICOM-910H radio is used to receive and transmit RF signals.

The BUV instrument consisted of a double monochromator containing all reflective optics and a photomultiplier detector. The double monochromator was composed of two Ebert-Fastie-type monochromators in tandem. The objective was to monitor the vertical distribution and total amount of atmospheric ozone on a global scale by measuring the intensity of UV radiation backscattered by the Earth/atmosphere system during day and night in the spectral band of 25-34 nm. - The new measurement technique of BUV total column ozone data led to it's acceptance by the international ozone community as a possible data source comparable to the Dobson instrument in ground observations. Prior to the development of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) and its predecessor BUV on the Nimbus-4 satellite, ozone measurements were obtained via ground-based Dobson spectrophotometer stations (local measurements only). Global observations of ozone on a daily basis were provided with TOMS, first flown on the Nimbus-7 mission of NASA (launch Oct. 24, 1978). During its lifetime on Nimbus-7, the analysis of TOMS data helped make ”ozone” a household word through its false-color images of the “Antarctic Ozone Hole.” - Note: The Antarctic Ozone Hole was first noticed by a research group of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) from data obtained with a Dobson ozone"

They reported the mean daily value of ozone at Halley Bay Station for the four latest complete observing seasons during Antarctic springtime (October 1980 to March 1984) in 1985. At about the same time the TOMS group at NASA also noticed unusual ozone values in the Antarctic. Satellite measurements then confirmed that the springtime ozone loss in the Antarctic was a continent-wide feature. In fact, TOMS has been a key instrument for monitoring ozone levels on a global scale. - Even after 14 years of operations (1992), TOMS was testing new concepts such as nowcasting of winds at flight altitudes and volcanic ash clouds. Nowcasting refers to real-time ozone mapping that occurs when satellite data is processed and displayed on a computer screen simultaneously as the satellite passes overhead.

At each scan position, the Earth radiance was monitored at six wavelengths between 310 and 380 nm to infer the total ozone amount. The TOMS completed a cross scan in eight seconds, with one second for retrace, to record 35 scenes per scan. At each scene, a chopper sequentially sampled all six wavelengths four times.

As it rotated, openings at different distances from the center of the wheel would pass over the exit slits, allowing measurements at the different wavelengths. The order was not one of monotonically increasing or decreasing wavelength; four samples at each wavelength were interleaved in a way designed to minimize the effect of scene changes on the ozone retrieval.

A mirror scanned perpendicular to the orbital plane in 3º steps from 51º on the right side of spacecraft nadir to 51º on the left (relative to direction of flight), for a total of 35 samples.

The optics of the two instruments (Nimbus-7 and Meteor-3-6) were identical: a single, fixed monochromator, with exit slits at six near-UV wavelengths. The slit functions were triangular with a nominal 1nm bandwidth. The order of individual measurements was determined by a chopper wheel. As it rotated, openings at different distances from the center of the wheel would pass over the exit slits, allowing measurements at the different wavelengths. The order was not one of monotonically increasing or decreasing wavelength; four samples at each wavelength were interleaved in a way designed to minimize the effect of scene changes on the ozone retrieval. The IFOV of the instrument was 3º x 3º. A mirror scanned perpendicular to the orbital plane in 3º steps from 51º on the right side of spacecraft nadir to 51º on the left (relative to direction of flight), for a total of 35 samples. At the end of the scan, the mirror would quickly return to the first position, not making measurements on the retrace. Eight seconds after the start of the previous scan, another would begin. Consecutive cross scans overlapped, creating a contiguous mapping. TOMS has a swath width of 3100 km. Six spectral bands at: 0.3125, 0.3175, 0.3313, 0.3398, 0.360, and 0.380 µm.

Two narrow entrance slits, slightly offset, are imaged over the 312.5 nm exit slit when the 296.7 nm radiation illuminates them.

The reflectance calibration (RCAL) is for monitoring the reflectivity of the diffuser surfaces. The Reflectance Calibration Assembly (RCA), a light source for RCA, is made of a mercury pen lamp with a reflector which has a window coated with a mixture of phosphors. This phosphor mixture produces a broad spectral emissions over the TOMS wavelength range when excited by the mercury ultraviolet radiation.

Known as ESA’s ‘Water Mission’, SMOS will improve our understanding of Earth’s water cycle, providing much-needed data for modelling of the weather and climate, and increasing the skill in numerical weather and climate prediction. One of the highest priorities in Earth science and environmental policy issues today is to understand the potential consequences of modification of Earth’s water cycle due to climate change. The influence of increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols on atmospheric water vapor concentrations, clouds, precipitation patterns and water availability must be understood in order to predict the consequences for water availability for consumption and agriculture. The main science objective of the SMOS mission is to demonstrate observations of SSS (Sea Surface Salinity) over oceans and SM (Soil Moisture) over land to advance climatologic, meteorologic, hydrologic, and oceanographic applications. Soil moisture is a key variable in the hydrologic cycle. Over land, water and energy fluxes at the surface/atmosphere interface are strongly dependent upon soil moisture. SM is an important variable for numerical weather and climate models as well as in surface hydrology and in vegetation monitoring. Knowledge of the global distribution of salt in the oceans and of its annual and inter-annual variability, is crucial for"

Ocean circulation is mainly driven by the momentum and heat fluxes through the atmosphere/ocean interface, it is dependent on water density gradients, which in turn can be traced by the observation of SSS and SST (Sea Surface Temperature). Soil moisture can be retrieved from brightness temperature observations. Due to the large dielectric contrast between dry soil and water, the soil emissivity ""epsilon"" at a particular microwave frequency depends upon the moisture content. At L-band in particular, the sensitivity to soil moisture is very high, whereas sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and surface roughness is minimal. For bare soils, for which the influence of near-surface soil moisture on surface water fluxes is strong, it has been shown that a random error of 0.04 m3 m-3 allows a good estimation of the evaporation and soil transfer parameters. For providing soil-moisture maps to global atmospheric models, a 50 km resolution is adequate, and will allow hydrological modelling with sufficient detail for the world's largest hydrological basins. A 3 to 5 day revisit cycle is sufficient to retrieve a dose-zone soil-moisture content and evapo-transpiration, provided ancillary rainfall information is available. To track the quick-drying period after rain has fallen, which is very informative about the soil's hydraulic properties, a one- or two-day revisit interval is optimal. The stipulated 2.5 to 3 day bracket will satisfy the first objective always, and the second one most of the time. The precise time of the day is not critical for data acquisition, but the"

The retrievals will then be more accurate, but dew and morning frost can sometimes affect the measurements. For sea water, the dielectric constant is determined by the electrical conductivity and the microwave frequency. The ocean surface emissivity is a function of the dielectric constant and the state of the surface roughness. In principle it is possible to retrieve SSS from brightness temperature observations. - Mission requirements call for typical values to resolve specific phenomena: • Barrier layer effects on the tropical Pacific heat flux: accuracy of 0.2 psu (practical salinity unit), with a spatial resolution of 100 km x 100 km, and a revisit time of 30 days. Note: SSS is defined in practical salinity units (1 psu = 0.1%) and ranges from about 32 to 37 psu. In other words, salinity describes the concentration of dissolved salts in water; the psu value expresses the conductivity ratio. The average SSS is 35 psu, which is equivalent to 35 grams of salt in 1 liter of water. The sensitivity of brightness temperature to salinity is about 0.5 K/psu at a water temperature of 20ºC, decreasing to about 0.25 K/psu at 0ºC. Salinity links the climatic variations of the global water cycle and ocean circulation: - Salinity is required to determine seawater density, which in turn governs ocean circulation - Salinity variations are governed by freshwater fluxes due to precipitation, evaporation, runoff"

Since then, a successful Phase A feasibility study (2000-2001) and a Phase B (2002) for further definition and critical breadboarding have been completed (the Phase B payload design was completed in Oct. 2003). Approval for full implementation was given in Nov. 2003. The SMOS project is now well consolidated, the payload implementation Phase C/D started in mid-2004. The CDR (Critical Design Review) of the payload took place in Nov. 2005. Delivery of the fully tested payload PFM (Proto-Flight Model) to Alcatel Cannes is scheduled for the end of 2006.

The platform architecture is generic. Adaptations are limited to minor changes in software modules and launch vehicle interface. The S/C bus is a box, nearly 1 m per side, with all the equipment units accommodated on four lateral panels and the lower plate. The platform TCS (Thermal Control Subsystem) relies on passive radiators and active regulation with heaters. Electrical power is generated by two symmetric wing arrays with single-axis step motors. Each wing is composed of four deployable panels (1.5 m x 0.8 m) covered with silicon cells which provide 685 W orbital average after 3 year mission (EOL). The power is distributed through a single non-regulated primary electrical bus (23/36 V) using a Li-ion battery. The S/C is three-axis stabilized consisting of a PSM (Proteus Service Module) and a PLM (Payload Module). Typical pointing performance of better than 0.05º (3 σ) is provided by a control system with"

Coarse sun sensors (8) and two 3-axis magnetometers provide attitude measurement and magnetic torquers generate torque. In addition, two of the four reaction wheels are used to provide gyroscopic stiffness. A GPS receiver provides S/C location data for accurate orbit determinations and onboard time delivery. Due to the high variety of pointings to be handled with (earth pointing, yaw steering motion, inertial pointing, etc.) the AOCS concept has been based from the beginning on a gyro stellar hybridation with reaction wheel actuators unloaded through magnetotorquer bars, while safe hold mode only relies on kinetic momentum, coarse sun sensors and magnetic sensors and actuators, without the use of the four 1N thrusters in blow down mode limited to orbit control manoeuvres. This design has a proven robust behavior on all the LEO orbits which have been used in the realized missions. The onboard command and data handling relies on a fully centralized architecture. The DHU (Data Handling Unit) performs most of the tasks through the central processor running the satellite software. It also supports the management of the communication links with all the satellite units either via discrete point-to-point lines or via a MIL-STD-1553B bus. SMOS is designed to operate mostly in an autonomous mode using the FDIR (Failure Detection Isolation and Recovery) concept (this permits to reduce drastically the working hours per day from the ground).

The design life is three years with a goal of five years. The SMOS spacecraft features an attitude in which the boresight of the antenna is forward tilted by 32.5º with respect to nadir. This configuration enables measurements at line-of-sight angles between 0º - 50º. The satellite employs yaw steering about the local normal.

Launch: The SMOS spacecraft was launched on November 2, 2009 on a Rockot launch vehicle (the 3rd stage of Rockot is Breeze-KM) of ELS (Eurockot Launch Services) from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia. The first burn of Breeze-KM is to acquire an elliptical transfer orbit. The second burn serves to circularize the orbit to its nominal parameters. A secondary payload on this flight is the PROBA-2 spacecraft of ESA. Some 70 minutes after launch, SMOS successfully separated from the Rockot’s Breeze-KM upper stage. Shortly thereafter, the satellite’s initial telemetry was acquired by the Hartebeesthoek ground station, near Johannesburg, South Africa. The upper stage then performed additional maneuvers to arrive at a slightly lower orbit and PROBA-2 was released too, some 3 hours into flight. Note: The SMOS satellite has been in storage at Thales Alenia Space's facilities in Cannes, France since May 2008 awaiting for a third stage of the Rockot launcher to be assigned to the mission and a slot given for launch from the Russian Plesetsk Cosmodrome.

Deforestation occurs when forests are cleared and converted completely. When forests are degraded, their health declines and they lose their capacity to support wildlife and people. - Forests play a crucial role in Earth’s carbon cycle by absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, keeping our planet cool. However, forest degradation and deforestation, particularly in the tropical regions, are causing much of this stored carbon to be released back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. - A recent study, published in Nature Climate Change, investigated the dynamics of forest carbon in the Brazilian Amazon from 2010–2019. The authors estimated that the Brazilian Amazon experienced a cumulative gross loss of 4.45 Pg C against a gross gain of 3.78 Pg C – resulting in a net loss of 0.67 Pg C of above ground biomass over the last decade. - According to co-author Philippe Ciais, “This net loss of carbon from the Brazilian Amazon forest is equivalent to seven years of fossil carbon dioxide emissions by the UK.” Philippe Ciais is also the science leader for the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes project, as part of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative. - He adds, “The study shows that climate spells, like the severe El Niño of"

Forest degradation – more important than thought - Over the past half century, terrestrial ecosystems have absorbed a third of year-on-year carbon dioxide emissions, despite emissions almost doubling over the same period. Tropical rainforests, including the Amazon, contributed significantly to this process as a particularly efficient carbon sink. - Professor Ciais points out that the study shows that human activities that ‘nibble away’ at forest carbon stocks by degradation induced by fires, logging and landscape fragmentation, contribute three times more to gross carbon loss from above ground biomass compared to deforestation. - He says, “Forest degradation is difficult to measure directly using optical satellite data because it often occurs at very small scales, for instance only the largest trees are removed by selective logging. The advantage of using the SMOS microwave data is that despite their coarse resolution, they capture the net biomass loss from all processes in a given region.” - According to the study authors, reducing forest degradation must be a policy priority in the Brazilian Amazon to reach the requirement"

These maps are pertinent in helping to support forest management, emissions reduction and sustainable development policy goals. - The maps are derived from a combination of data, depending on the year, from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, Envisat’s ASAR instrument and JAXA’s Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1 and ALOS-2), along with additional information from Earth observation sources. Looking to the future - ESA’s upcoming Biomass mission will provide crucial information about the state of our forests and how they are changing. From over 650 km above, the Biomass satellite will be able to ‘see’ through the leafy forest canopy to return information about the forest structure that can be used to calculate forest height and biomass. - The mission will take forest counting to a new level by using a type of instrument that has never been flown in space before: a ‘P-band’ synthetic aperture radar – the longest radar wavelength available to Earth observation. - Information from the Biomass mission will lead to a better understanding of the state of Earth’s forests, how they are changing over time, and advance our knowledge of the carbon cycle. • May 5, 2021: The MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis) instrument is a passive microwave 2-D interferometric radiometer (L-Band, 1.4 GHz,"

It picks up faint microwave emissions from Earth's surface to map levels of soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness and others geophysical variable such as wind speed over ocean and freeze/ thaw soil state. It remains the first, and so far the only, one of its kind in space. The main feature of MIRAS is that it obtains two-dimensional images at every snapshot without needing any mechanical scanning of its antenna, distinct to traditional scanners or push-broom radiometers. But, different error sources cause different effects on the SMOS brightness temperature images. Bias and ripples appear in images acquired over any region of the Earth, be it land, ice or coastlines. The bias is interpreted as a spatial ripple of an infinite spatial wavelength, the cause and existence of which was already studied before SMOS launch. - Further investigations conducted since the spatial ripple was previously analyzed, along with SMOS's full data record, has allowed better understanding of the ripple's origins. A new activity with TDE and Airbus, Spain, has demonstrated, using measurements performed with real hardware,that an interferometer could be built with a significantly lower spatial ripple, which is important for future radiometer missions using aperture synthesis and will improve image quality of any follow on SMOS missions. - The activity demonstrated experimentally that a two-dimensional radiometer such as MIRAS, i.e. with an hexagonal geometry, can be built having one order of magnitude lower noise floor by both reducing the element spacing of SMOS and surrounding every active"

While addressing key scientific questions, this exceptional Earth Explorer has repeatedly surpassed expectations by returning a wide range of unexpected results, often leading to practical applications that improve everyday life. Adding to SMOS’ list of talents, new findings show that what was considered noise in the mission’s data can actually be used to monitor solar activity and space weather, which can damage communication and navigation systems. - The SMOS satellite carries a novel interferometric radiometer that operates at a frequency of 1.4 GHz in the L-band microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum to capture ‘brightness temperature’ images. These images correspond to radiation emitted from Earth’s surface, which scientists then use to derive information on soil moisture and ocean salinity. - However, because of the wide field of view of SMOS’ antenna, it doesn’t just capture signals emitted from Earth’s surface, but also signals from the Sun – which create noise in the brightness temperature images.

Changes in the light coming from the Sun, known as solar flares, or in the solar wind, which carries coronal mass ejections, are referred to as space weather. - These flares or mass ejections can damage communication networks, navigation systems such as GPS, and other satellites. Severe solar storms can even cause power outages on Earth. Understanding and monitoring space weather is, therefore, important for early warnings and taking precautionary measures. - Manuel Flores-Soriano, from the University of Alcalá in Spain, said, “We found that SMOS can detect solar radio bursts and even weaker variations in emissions from the Sun, such as the 11-year solar cycle. - “Solar radio bursts detected by SMOS brightness temperature signals from the Sun are generally observed during flares that are associated with coronal mass ejections. We have also found a correlation between the amount of solar flux released at 1.4 GHz and the speed, angular width and kinetic energy of coronal mass ejections.” - These new results published in Space Weather describe how SMOS has the unique ability to observe the Sun continually with full polarimetry – making it a promising instrument for monitoring solar interference affecting Global Navigation Satellite"

The maps show drier-than-usual soil moisture conditions from 10 April to 10 May 2020, compared to the average observations over the same period over the past six years (2015-2020). - Some areas display a 30% difference compared to the average, with the Olomouc and Ústí regions appearing to be the most affected. - Richard de Jeu, from VanderSat, comments, “When compared to the average, or what we consider ‘normal’ conditions, a 30% difference in spring can be considered catastrophic for agriculture and nature if this drought persists throughout the summer.” - Droughts are major natural hazards and have wide-reaching economic, social and environmental impacts.

It is thanks to data from ESA’s SMOS satellite and the Copernicus Sentinels missions that make our soil moisture service possible.” - Klaus Scipal, ESA’s SMOS Mission Manager, says, “It is impressive to see that even after 10 years of operations, SMOS is still in a very healthy condition and it keeps on delivering high-quality data to support sectors like the agribusiness and many others. SMOS delivers 96% of its data in less than three hours of sensing, which allows companies like Vandersat to make their observations instantly available to the agribusiness sector.” - Launched in 2009, SMOS is one of ESA’s Earth Explorer missions – which form the science and research element of the Living Planet Program. The SMOS satellite carries a novel interferometric radiometer that captures ‘brightness temperature’ images.

This is because the saltiness of the water depends on nearby additions of freshwater from rivers, rain, glaciers or ice sheets, or on the removal of water by evaporation. - The salinity of the ocean surface can be monitored from space using satellites to give a global view of the variable patterns of sea-surface salinity across the oceans. - Unusual salinity levels may indicate the onset of extreme climate events, such as El Niño. Global maps of sea-surface salinity are particularly helpful for studying the water cycle, ocean–atmosphere exchanges and ocean circulation, which are all vital components of the climate system transporting heat, momentum, carbon and nutrients around the globe. - A new and ongoing project for ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) – a research program dedicated to generating accurate and long-term datasets for 21 Essential Climate Variables, required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – has generated the most complete global dataset of sea-surface salinity from space to date. - “The project aims to make a significant improvement to the quality and length of the datasets available for monitoring sea-surface salinity across the globe,” says Susanne Mecklenburg, head of ESA’s Climate Office. “We are keen to see this new dataset used and tested in a variety of applications, particularly to improve our understanding of the fundamental role that oceans"

The data for this, however, are relatively coarse, taken by ships. - It is only since the beginning of the 21st century that ocean floats called Argo have been installed, on average every 300 km, to provide subsurface salinity vertical profiles between approximately 5 m and 2000 m depth at 10-day intervals. - “Monitoring salinity from space helps to resolve spatial and temporal scales that are poorly sampled by in situ platforms that make direct observations, and fills gaps in the observing system,” says Dr Boutin. - Ocean–atmosphere exchanges are driven by winds around the globe, as well as by exchanges between the surface and subsurface ocean owing to changes in the density of the water itself.

Regional changes in salinity are linked to periodic inter-annual climate events such as the El Niño. Salinity is also implicated in the intensification of the global water cycle. - To demonstrate the benefits of the new dataset, ESA’s CCI Sea Surface Salinity project is carrying out a number of climate studies.

Until recently, it has been difficult to monitor ‘ocean acidification’, but scientists are exploring new ways to combine information from different sources, including from ESA’s SMOS mission, to shed new light on this major environmental concern. - As the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to rise, our oceans are playing an increasingly important role in absorbing some of this excess. In fact, it was reported recently that the global ocean annually draws down about a third of the carbon released into the atmosphere by human activities. - While this long-term absorption means that the planet isn’t as hot as it would be otherwise, the process is causing the ocean’s carbonate chemistry to change: seawater is becoming less alkaline – a process commonly known as ocean acidification. - In turn, this is altering bio-geo-chemical cycles and having a detrimental effect on ocean life. - With the damaging effects of ocean acidification already becoming evident, it is vital that the current shift in pH is monitored closely. Covering over 70% of Earth’s surface, ocean wellbeing also has a bearing on the health and balance of the rest of the planet. - Recent advances in data capture have included state-of-the-art pH instruments on ships and floats, but we can gain a global view by taking measurements from space.

Any two of these parameters, along with measurements of salinity and temperature, allow us to understand the complete carbon chemistry of the ocean. - ESA’s SMOS mission and NASA’s Aquarius mission, which both provide information on ocean salinity, have been key to the research.

This remarkable satellite mission has shown that it can be used to measure how the temperature of the Antarctic ice sheet changes with depth – and it’s much warmer deep down. - The Antarctic ice sheet is, on average, about 2 km thick, but in some places the bedrock is almost 5 km below the surface of this huge polar ice cap. - Most of us would probably think that the temperature of ice, no matter how thick, remains pretty much the same throughout: basically very cold. - However, although the surface of the ice sheet is cold, the temperature increases with depth primarily because of the basal geothermal heating from beneath Earth’s crust. In places, it is warm enough to melt the ice, which accounts for the presence of lakes and a vast hydrological network at the bedrock. - Nevertheless, there is little accurate information on exactly how temperature varies with depth other than from ice core borehole locations. - Since the massive white ice sheets that blanket Antarctica and Greenland reflect incident solar radiation back out into space, they are extremely important regulators in the climate system and, therefore, play a key role in the health of our planet. - But, ice sheets are also victims of climate change.

In turn, ice flow affects the temperature profile through strain heating – so it’s a complicated process. - Temperature information is also fundamental for understanding the presence of aquifers inside or at the bottom part of ice sheets. This can be relevant for indicating the presence of sub-glacial lakes, for example, which, in turn, influence ice-sheet dynamics. - How temperature varies according to the depth of the ice is not something that could be measured from space until now – but according to a paper published recently in Science Direct, SMOS is opening up new opportunities to do so. - Giovanni Macelloni from the Institute of Applied Physics ‘Nello Carrara’ of the National Research Council (IFAC-CNR) in Italy, said, “We typically get ice-sheet temperature profiles from"

This remarkable satellite has not only exceeded its planned life in orbit, but also surpassed its original scientific goals. It was designed to deliver data on soil moisture and ocean salinity which are both crucial components of Earth’s water cycle. By consistently mapping these variables, SMOS is not only advancing our understanding of the water cycle and the exchange processes between Earth’s surface and the atmosphere, but is also helping to improve weather forecasts and contributing"

After almost 10 years of successful Operations, the status of the SMOS mission is excellent. However, SMOS observations are significantly affected by RF interference (RFI) in several world areas. - Since the first SMOS mission observations, its radiometer in the passive band 1400-1427 MHz detected RFI sources. Any emission in this band is prohibited by ITU Radio-Regulations (RR No.5340). To successfully accomplish the decrease in the global number of interfering sources, two parties are required: SMOS RFI team – to detect, monitor and report the cases of harmful interference – and national regulatory authorities – to investigate and take remedial actions to solve the RFI case (i.e. remove unauthorized devices, fix malfunctioning equipment or optimize operational settings). Some examples of devices causing interference are presented in this paper, showing the impact on the SMOS science data according to the topology of the interfering device. Worldwide RFI Status - As the SMOS satellite measures the brightness temperature (BT) in the surface of the Earth, the detected RFI sources are classified in three levels: moderate, strong and very strong sources. - In Europe, North America and China, the improvement in the RFI scenario between 2010 and nowadays is mostly a consequence of the actions taken by spectrum management national authorities following the RFI reports provided by ESA. In other areas such"

Interfering devices - During these years, the SMOS RFI team has found several types of interference sources according to their topology, power and behavior. 44). They can be broken down by intensity: high power (a) vs low power (b); by emission features: omnidirectional (c) vs directive (d) vs pulsed (e) probably scanning beam; or by spatial distribution: ext
