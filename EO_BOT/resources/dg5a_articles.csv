A new horizon for the development of human knowledge had been identified and the space race had begun. If space was once a new frontier to be crossed, it is now a new front that we have to defend. In a world at the mercy of live, unpredictable, technological threats, and at a time when powers are looking to assert themselves, space is a cornerstone of our defence. Space capabilities are a critical factor of all our operations, whether anticipating and planning manoeuvres, locating the enemy, guiding our forces in the field or communicating. The sudden emergence of disruptive innovation methods in the space sector  known generically as New Space  calls for a change in the way we approach the development of our space capabilities. Alongside central governments, private-sector actors play a key role in the economic development of a space industry which is now more flexible, more innovative, more connected to other segments of the economy. The United States and China have long grasped the importance of this crucial turning-point for the development of our societies. Europe and France cannot turn a blind eye to an emerging area of potential conflict.That is why the President of the Republic has made"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,2,"space a priority for our defence. We must concentrate our efforts on identifying and characterising unfriendly or hostile acts in the vicinity of our satellites, on continuing to develop our means of operational support, protecting our space assets and discouraging our adversaries from harming them. In response to these challenges, the Armed Forces Ministry has devised an ambitious space defence strategy for the period to 2030, spanning all aspects. While the renewal of our entire satellite capability is already scheduled under the Military Planning Act, an additional effort will be made to enhance our space situational awareness and acquire initial capabilities in newly identified areas, especially the detection of potentially malicious space activities and the protection of our space assets. We will step up cooperation with our European partners while maintaining our close relationship with the United States. I am also counting on our industrial partners to continue and nurture the relations of trust we have established.  In terms of governance, the President of the Republic has announced the creation of a major space command, attached to the Air Force, whose sole purpose will be to prepare us for these new challenges. The Air Force will thus become the Air and Space Force. It marks a historic turning-point.In order to meet these challenges and carry out genuine military space operations we will have to strengthen geographical and functional synergies with CNES, which has a tremendous pool of space expertise and is a real asset for France and its defence. We have everything we need to"

Affecting commercial, industrial and geostrategic interests, it presents so many challenges, including of a security nature, that France cannot simply ignore it. A space power for decades, France has undeniable assets and our armed forces have been using space for many years, mainly for strategic intelligence purposes and to support land, air and sea operations. Emerging technologies in what is generally referred to as New Space are paving the way not only for new opportunities that should be grasped but also for new threats that need to be addressed. The current French space model needs to be rethought in order to adapt to these disruptions. While the approach to space as an enabler is indeed being modernised, the notion of space as a domain with its own challenges has not yet been fully addressed. That is the aim of this report, which outlines the future of our space defence in accordance with a roadmap that looks to 2030 and beyond. It is intended to inform interministerial discussions that take place elsewhere. ***The use of outer space is governed by a specific legal framework which guarantees freedom of exploration and use to all. There is no call to revise existing space treaties. However, our freedom of access to and action in space could be compromised. The"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,6,"sudden emergence of New Space is tilting the existing balances: disruptive technologies and uses and faster-moving innovation cycles are rapidly changing the criteria on which space power is based. Both a threat and an opportunity, these developments are forcing us to rethink both our industrial model and our governance of space. Strategic competition is hotting up. Our space capabilities contribute to the strategic knowledge-and-anticipation function, reinforce the credibility of our deterrent and support our operations, whether through observation, telecommunications, signals intelligence or navigational assistance. They contribute to our operational superiority, fully justifying the resources earmarked for them under the Military Planning Act 2019-2025. These capabilities must therefore be secured for the future and renewed. But there is more to be done: French actors in both the public and the private sector must guard against more recent threats, such as the proliferation of space debris, jamming, blinding and directed-energy weapons.***This new environment implies a space defence strategy founded on the protection of our capabilities. That involves first and foremost improving our space situational awareness (SSA), especially in order to detect and attribute unfriendly or hostile acts in all orbits of interest and defend ourselves against them. Without calling into question the peaceful and responsible use of space, that aim will be pursued within the existing legal framework, especially for self-defence within the meaning of the United Nations Charter. Promoting responsible behaviour and best practices and contributing to the definition of international standards will also form part of the strategy.The domestic legal framework will also have to be"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,7,"adapted at interministerial level in order to take better account of the specific characteristics of military space operations, the scope of which will be extended (in particular the role of operator, manoeuvres and security requirements). A definition will also be needed of trusted operators on which the Ministry may call for services to support operations and ensure their resilience, so that asset acquisition can focus on the most strategic sectors.That strategy must take advantage of the opportunities offered by New Space. Over the coming years, the use of constellations of 10 11SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019small satellites will help to improve our military capabilities and our resilience in relation to observation, telecommunications and space surveillance. Downstream, processing the mass of data produced will be a major issue: automation and artificial intelligence will be crucial in order to extract maximum value from the Ministrys investments over the period of the Military Planning Act (MPA).In industrial terms, French companies have technologies that foster the development of these capabilities, whether they operate in a purely domestic or, in many cases, a multinational framework. They must be given support: innovation must be stimulated by a revised system of state governance, and balances within the ecosystem of start-ups, SMEs, intermediate-sized enterprises and major contractors should be reset. For launchers, the current model will be sustained by the reassertion of European preference for institutional launches. European cooperation will be pursued mainly around a Franco-German core based on complementary SSA resources with a view to laying the foundations"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,8,"for an autonomous European space capability in the future. However, this does not rule out the pursuit or development of cooperation with other international partners, especially the United States.***That strategic ambition will be backed up firstly by a revised doctrine for military space operations based on four functions: space service support, situational awareness, operations support and active space defence. The revision of doctrine must be underpinned by a consolidated assessment of the threats to our capabilities. Another priority must be to strengthen the overall resilience of our armed forces, which must remain capable of acting without space support.In order to immediately impart fresh impetus, the chain of command for space assets within the Armed Forces Ministry will be adapted in accordance with the principles of joint operational effectiveness, sustainability, coherence of the domain and visibility of the organisation. A specific space pillar within the Air Force, which could be renamed the Air and Space Force, will be set up in the summer of 2019. The various military space organisations will gradually be brought together within it, following a rationale of fostering closer functional and geographical links with CNES, the National Centre for Space Studies. In addition, a start may already be made on identifying financial and organisational synergies, especially in the management of space programmes and operations, in order to rethink the relationship between the Armed Forces Ministry and CNES. Areas of particular attention for the management of space programmes are the division of commissioning-authority responsibilities and the Ministrys exercise of oversight over CNES, and the"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,9,"refocusing of state expertise on projects (R&T, demonstrators, etc.) where the degree of industrial maturity is not yet sufficient. The defence innovation agency must also provide input into the guidelines for space R&T carried out by CNES and ONERA, the French Aerospace Research Centre.In terms of capability, it is essential to ensure the long-term viability of assets which provide strategic intelligence and operations support, making greater use of automated mass data processing and building connectivity into future weapons programmes from the outset. Developing a comprehensive SSA capability will be a priority. A number of steps will be taken as of 2019, including studies for the renewal and extension of existing capabilities and services, a specific cooperation initiative with Germany and the evaluation of industrial projects for the observation of space from space. Active and passive measures to protect satellites whose placement in orbit is already scheduled will be stepped up. In addition, a genuine capability for action in space will be acquired by 2030, drawing on feedback from demonstrators developed under MPA 2019-2025. The constitution of a pool of experts and the creation of attractive career paths are key factors of autonomy and success in helping 12 13SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019to guide and achieve this new ambition. The establishment of a space academy will help to coordinate the necessary training for military personnel and ministry staff operating in the space domain.***Overall, this space defence strategy marks a turning-point for the future of our armed forces and for Frances capacity to"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,10,"act in all domains and maintain its strategic autonomy of assessment and decision. Although we will still need armed forces capable of gaining operational superiority on land, at sea and in the air, as well as in the more recent spheres of cyber and influence, space must henceforth be seen as the fifth domain of action in which our military strategy will be rolled out. We must unflinchingly address that new situation and ensure that in the future France will have the means to defend itself in space.  1  SPACE IS AN ESSENTIAL DOMAIN FOR THE ARMED FORCES BUT ACCESS TO IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONTESTEDSpace makes a vital contribution to our security and to the operation of our economies and societies. Although we are becoming increasingly dependent on space, growing tensions in that area threaten our freedom of access and action. 1.1  Space is a domain in its own right, used until now mainly for strategic purposes and operational support 1.1.1  A specific geography with restrictive physical laws. The specific conditions that prevail in space make it a domain in its own right, even if there is no clear-cut physical frontier with airspace or Earths atmosphere. It can essentially be divided into two zones, near-Earth space and outer space. Until around 2040, near space is likely to be the area of particular interest for the armed forces. Near space is subdivided into three main orbital zones:14 15SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019-  Low Earth Orbits (LEO),"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,11,"with an altitude of 2,000 km or less, mainly used to place observation satellites1 and telecommunications satellites;-  Medium Earth Orbits (MEO), with an altitude between 2,000 and 35,786 km, mainly used to place radio-navigation satellites for systems such as GPS and Galileo;-  Geostationary Orbits (GEO), a specific type of geosynchronous orbits which are of particular interest for many civilian and military uses, such as telecommunications and early warning satellites, because the satellite is stationary in relation to Earth. Retaining the most advantageous slots in these orbits is a major strategic issue.Further distinctions may be drawn:-  Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO) are terrestrial orbits whose apogee is greater than 35,786 km. Satellites placed in these orbits have long dwell times close to their apogee and pass close to Earth very quickly at their perigee. They are thus of considerable interest for early warning or communications in high latitudes (as a palliative solution for geostationary satellites for latitudes of over 60, for example) if their apogee is situated over the poles;-  Geostationary Transfer Orbits are intermediate orbits from which satellites can be placed in geostationary orbit. Space is a particularly hostile environment in which equipment is subject to extreme temperature variations and ionising radiation. The risk of collision is also a source of concern. Successive launches, accidents and destructions in orbit have generated pieces of debris2 that represent so many risks for our space capabilities. Items measuring between one and ten centimetres 1  These satellites are mostly placed in Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO) so"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,12,"that they always pass over a given point on the Earths surface at the same local mean solar time. 2  The catalogue to date counts 20,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimetres, 350,000 to 750,000 larger than one centimetre and at least 35 million larger than one millimetre. Over 6,000 tons of debris now orbit Earth. will cause very substantial damage on conjunction with a satellite. Items larger than ten centimetres can completely destroy a satellite, creating large amounts of new debris.Although the amount of debris tends to stabilise because of natural deorbiting (12 years for an object at an altitude of 500 km) and greater general awareness of the issue, the foreseeable increase in the number of launches multiplies the risk of conjunction. That in turn generates a need for precise knowledge, which is one of the major challenges of space situational awareness, especially as 50% of the debris currently in orbit will still be there in 20 years time.1.1.2   A liberal legal frameworkThe freedom to explore and use outer space, the province of all mankind, is enshrined in international law on space activities, especially the 1967 Outer Space Treaty3. As Res communis, outer space is free of access and use, unlike airspace, over which the underlying State exercises full and exclusive sovereignty. As there is no definition of space for lack of political consensus, a pragmatic approach qualifies any object that has made at least one full orbit as a space object4. Under these conditions, access to and use of"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,13,"Earth orbits, including the lowest, are free, leaving States all latitude to carry out the space activities of their choice there.The legal rules governing space regulate States practice but also guarantee the freedom of scientific research, meaning that no space application, civilian or military, is prohibited in principle. This regime by nature favours initiative and diversification of both actors and the offer of space services.3  The catalogue to date counts 20,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimetres, 350,000 to 750,000 larger than one centimetre and at least 35 million larger than one millimetre. Over 6,000 tons of debris now orbit Earth. 4  The zone at issue is situated between 80 and 120 km above sea level. While organisations like the FAI regard the Karman line (altitude of 100 km) as the frontier between the atmosphere and space, France, like other space powers, considers it inappropriate, given the present state of space activities, to define and delimit space. 16 17SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019The free use of space is not absolute, however, since it is curtailed by the requirement to respect the interests of all countries5  and by international law. Thus, the use or occupation of space may not result in the creation of a sovereign right in favour of a State exercising that freedom. On this basis, the International Telecommunication Union ensures equitable and fair access to orbital slots and radio-electric frequencies. Some doubt is being cast on this non-appropriation principle at present, since certain States consider,"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,14,"for example, that it does not apply to minerals or other resources that could be extracted from celestial bodies6. The prospect of the exploitation of space is an issue for the future that should not be overlooked.Although international law states that space must be used for peaceful purposes, that does not mean that all military activity in space is prohibited. The Outer Space Treaty permits the militarisation7 and even weaponisation8 of Earth orbits, provided that weapons of mass destruction are not deployed there, as well as the use of force, strictly within the framework of the United Nations Charter. However, the Moon, celestial bodies and their orbits are entirely demilitarised9.Space activities do not fall within any jurisdiction other than that implied by their attachment to a State or an international organisation. States are free to define the terms of any such attachment, which differ according to nationally prescribed rules.States are responsible under international law for their national space activities, whether undertaken by government agencies or non-governmental organisations. In accordance with this 5  Outer Space Treaty, Article I. 6  The United States, Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates, for example, have passed domestic legislation authorising the private exploitation of such resources. 7  Militarisation means the placement in orbit of satellites for military purposes, such as intelligence, navigation and telecommunication satellites (cf. joint concept paper 3.3.13-ESPACE no. 27/DEF/CICDE/DR of 4 February 2014. 8  Weaponisation means the placement in orbit of systems capable of attaining objectives on Earth or in orbit, and not merely systems"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,15,"to support military operations (cf. above-mentioned joint concept paper of 4 February 2014). 9  See Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty and Article 3 of the Agreement of 5 December 1979 (signed but not ratified by France) Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. principle, States are required to authorise and continuously monitor private space activities10 pursued from their territory or by their nationals, whether individuals or legal entities, acting outside their territory, through measures such as the registration of objects and the authorisation of launches. In order to implement this treaty monitoring obligation, many States have introduced domestic regulatory arrangements with often widely differing content. The regulatory framework in France is established by the Space Operations Act11, which is essentially commercial and civilian in scope.1.1.3   A vector of strategic capabilities essential to our operationsFrance had already identified space as a major factor of power and strategic independence in the 1960s, especially for the development of its nuclear deterrent. Having invested massively in the space sector, it is now one of the few nations capable of developing satellites, placing them in orbit, keeping them on station and exploiting the data collected. France is therefore a genuine space power, both civilian and military.The armed forces have used space to support their operations since the 1990s, making a decisive contribution to their freedom of action on land, at sea and in the air.Control over optical or radar observation, signals intelligence, satellite telecommunications and satellite meteorology, navigation and synchronisation is"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,16,"essential to autonomous situational awareness, decision and action and hence a core concern for the armed forces.Space observation (via the Helios 2, Pliades and, shortly, CSO satellites) meets the need for non-intrusive intelligence gathering and support for operations and military geography. As part of a geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) system which contributes to autonomous situational awareness by pooling and analysing   10  Public space activities are presumed to be carried out with government consent. 11  Act 2008-518 of 3 June 2008 on space operations.18 19SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019location-based data from various sources, space observation complements other means of reconnaissance, especially in contested spaces.Space-based electronic signals intelligence (the ELISA demonstrator and forthcoming CERES satellites) has been defence-specific until now and provides information about adversary activity.Satellite telecommunications (Syracuse III and forthcoming Syracuse IV satellites) provide secure communications between forces in the field and mainland France and across theatres of operations, regardless of distance and independent of ground relays. They also meet the need for greater connectivity inherent in modern weapons systems and contribute to our armed forces first-strike capability. Satellite radio-navigation and synchronisation systems are used in most of the armed forces weapons, communications and information systems. Our operations have become very heavily dependent on access to these services, as has everyday life in our societies in general (cf. 1.1.4). Space can also meet other needs for prevention and the protection of our national territory and interests, especially through two capabilities: -  early warning, which contributes to the monitoring"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,17,"of proliferation and ballistic missile activities, ballistic missile defence, aggressor identification, passive defence and space surveillance (cf. 3.3.5);  -  maritime surveillance via automatic detection, a potentially dual-use capability which complements existing non-space means of maritime surveillance, whether civilian or military, maritime, airborne or terrestrial.1.1.4  A key factor for the operation of our economies and societiesSpace is a pervasive feature of all human activities, whether domestic, economic, financial, scientific or whatever. In order to meet these core social, even vital needs, it provides four types of data.Data from observation of the Earth and its atmosphere provide the foundation for weather forecasting and mapping services, the monitoring of natural, climatic and environmental risk, assistance to people in need, border surveillance and defence.Telecommunications data provide access to TV and telephone networks and the internet in parts of the world without the necessary ground infrastructure (blind spots), helping in particular to bridge the digital divide.Location data from constellations of satellites in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS and Galileo are used extensively to locate land, sea, water and air vehicles of all types and have fostered personalised smartphone apps. GNSS signals also include extremely precise and reliable time information and are consequently used everywhere to synchronise digital networks such as banking systems, telecommunications networks and power grids. GNSS are certainly the most widely used satellite systems. Losing them would cause severe disruption to our societies, going far beyond the purely military sphere. Data from scientific and exploration missions include all the information of fundamental interest"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,18,"that enables us to explore the laws of physics and understand our universe, such as the composition of comets, the environment on Mars, the structure of black holes and the discovery of exoplanets.In the near future, technological advances will pave the way for new high value-added applications engendered by the link between satellite infrastructure and, for example, the Internet of Things, telemedicine, digital learning and autonomous vehicles. The falling 20 21SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  201921cost of access to space will also soon open it up to tourism. At the same time, as we have seen, more and more countries are taking an interest in the exploitation of resources on asteroids or in space more generally. Other applications that we cannot yet foresee will appear in the years to come, driven by sectoral needs.1.2  In a context of fiercer industrial and strategic competition, our freedom of access and action could be compromised1.2.1  New Space is disrupting the existing equilibrium The space industry has long been the preserve of a handful of big countries, their space agencies and publicly funded companies. That situation was linked to the essentially strategic nature of space activities (few commercial uses), the very substantial investment required and long development cycles.New Space, originating in the United States, has profoundly changed that landscape. Using methods, technologies, facilities and financial engineering techniques, especially venture capital, developed by the new economy in areas such as miniaturisation, electronics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence, it has opened up the traditional space sector,"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,19,"significantly cut costs and democratised access to space.New Space actors, whether private investors, universities, start-ups or large companies, have taken an innovative approach which involves accelerated decision-taking, innovation in use, greater willingness to take risks, tolerance of failure as a factor of progress and acceptance of lower systems reliability.The upshot has been the emergence of projects for commercial constellations of dozens or hundreds or even thousands of objects. These in turn open up prospects for observation (higher revisit rate), data transmission (global coverage) and even electromagnetic eavesdropping, hitherto reserved for military applications.The accelerated development of mass information processing and dissemination completes the emergence of these proposed new uses and services. Here, the digital giants are positioning themselves as key players in New Space, whether upstream or downstream of the space value chain.The number of active satellites in orbit (around 2,000 at present) is thus likely to increase substantially over the next few years. Space surveillance and space traffic management are likely to become increasingly important issues. Active debris removal systems are being developed, along with systems capable of making orbital rendezvous in order to repair satellites, refuel them, keep them on station, move or deorbit them. Under cover of civilian objectives, States or private actors can thus openly finance potential anti-satellite technologies.There are also many initiatives to develop launchers, especially small ones. Financed by private institutions or organisations, over 40 models are currently being developed around the world, with upward of 40 more on the drawing-board.The opportunities offered by New Space have given decisive new impetus"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,20,"to the space sector. As with the emergence of the internet, a small number of projects will bear fruit but many investments will be written off.This major shift raises a fundamental question: how will the new actors cohabit with legacy operators who build increasingly sophisticated but expensive satellites which meet institutional needs and are mostly financed by public investment? It will be a crucial question, especially insofar as public investment will continue to be a decisive factor, even for the most innovative New Space projects.1.2.2  Strategic competition is hotting up, operational contexts are evolvingThe 2017 Defence and National Security Strategic Review noted an intensification of competition between powers, increasing the likelihood of state-to-state military confrontation. Countries with long-standing positions in space have also become increasingly dependent on it. As a result they have acquired new vulnerabilities 22 23SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019which they seek to alleviate by means of various strategies to secure pre-eminence, strengthening their means of action in space or embarking on a no-holds-barred policy of ramping up their capability.At the same time, the operational environment is becoming harsher and military capabilities are being strengthened, taking maximum advantage of information technologies applied to cyber and space. In the naval and air domains, for example, the improvement of space-based surveillance systems and the development of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems are casting doubt on the first-strike capability and freedom of action of our forces in theatres of operation. Our control of the electromagnetic spectrum (contributing to C4 ISTAR) is now"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,21,"strongly contested by potential adversaries who have invested massively in jamming and decoy capabilities which can degrade our capabilities in all domains (land, air, sea and space). Ballistic and cruise missile proliferation also exposes forces in the field to a growing risk. Space itself is becoming an area of possible confrontation in which alternative adversary strategies could be developed, below or beyond the threshold of armed conflict.Renewed attention should be paid to several parts of the world where tensions run high. Changing strategic dynamics, especially in Asia, are a continuing source of concern, especially as France remains relatively close to these regions, distant from its mainland, through a sovereign presence in its overseas territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Russia is seeking to rebuild a zone of influence on the eastern and northern flanks of Europe, while the Arctic could become a future area of confrontation in a context of international competition for control of its natural resources.In responding to these new challenges, space will continue to be one of the cornerstones of our operational capabilities, whether for the purposes of deterrence, support to operations or active space defence.1.2.3  Emerging new threats could compromise our freedom of access and actionThe major space powers are currently developing new systems capable not only of protecting their space capabilities but also of carrying out aggressive action against those of their adversaries. Even recently, unfriendly activities or demonstrations of power such as ASAT launches, proximity operations and the jamming of location systems have been observed.Rising space powers have"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,22,"also expressed their interest in developing offensive resources of this type. In addition, countries that have already proved their ability to get into space but do not yet have their own satellites could in the future raise the threat of kinetic or non-kinetic actions in space, deterring countries highly dependent on space from harming them.All these threats, ranging from the neutralisation to the destruction of an adversarys assets, rely on more or less mature and accessible technologies which may, over the next ten years, be able equally to target ground, communication or space segments and the software parts associated with them.Cyber threatsCyber-attacks on the software parts of the different segments of space capability are among the most likely threats, though they require precise knowledge of the targets technical parameters. Difficult to attribute, they may have reversible or irreversible effects including, at the most serious end of the scale, loss of control of payloads or even the platform itself, reducing it to junk. Electromagnetic jammingElectromagnetic jamming acts mainly on navigation receivers (GPS, Galileo) or satellite communications receivers. The effects of interference, frequent where satellite communications are 24 25SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019concerned, are generally reversible, though attributing the origin of the interference may be very complicated. Jamming targets the means of communication and the software parts of a satellite system in particular.Orbital servicesThe orbital services currently being developed by commercial enterprises and trials of proximity operations such as refuelling and cooperative inspection in the event of failure could be deflected from their"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,23,"purpose and the associated systems could be used as effectors capable of docking with, mooring on, capturing, degrading or displacing a satellite. Conventional threatsSabotage, malicious acts against ground infrastructure and the targeting of energy systems remain likely methods of action, albeit not specific to space. They take advantage of all the structural or human fragilities inherent in the ground-based protection of space systems, whether upstream of launch phases or in connection with the operation of ground stations. Their effects are attenuated by the redundancy of ground stations and the identification of vulnerable components to be protected.Kinetic threatsThe United States, Russia, China and now India have developed ground- or air-launched or co-orbital kinetic anti-satellite missile capabilities. Their use would have irreversible and drastic consequences in certain orbits, especially the unique geostationary orbit, generating a large amount of debris. 2  AN AMBITIOUS SPACE DEFENCE POLICY TO ENSURE OUR STRATEGIC AUTONOMYFaced with the strategic and industrial competition that threatens our freedom of access to and action in space, we must be able both to protect and defend our space interests and to strengthen our strategic autonomy in space by grasping the technological, industrial and cooperation opportunities which arise in that sphere.  2.1  Respond to threats in new operational contexts2.1.1  Consolidate and assert our strategy within the existing international legal framework The assertion of our national space defence strategy forms part of a fresh analysis of the space environment and the threats associated with it, underpinned by recognition that the capabilities of France and its partners"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,24,"in this domain are strategic by nature. Making a decisive contribution to national and international security and providing essential services to the population, space is a focal point for growing tensions. We must adapt our policy to cope with the emergence of new potential dangers and greater threats and risks.2.1.1.1  AmbitionIn this new environment, our space defence strategy has two strands. The first is to protect our satellites by enhancing our ability to monitor the space environment so that we can detect and attribute unfriendly or hostile acts in orbits of interest. In order to do so, France will draw on space situational awareness capabilities12, whether sovereign, developed and operated with other States (European partners, especially Germany), contracted to trusted commercial partners or operated by allies. The second is to be able to defend our space interests in space against unfriendly, wrongful or aggressive acts, in accordance and in compliance with international law. Our interests are not limited to French military satellites but may include French commercial satellites, some allied satellites and EU satellites.12  See 3.4.2. 26 27SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  20192.1.1.2  Principles of actionThree key success factors will help to consolidate this strategy. The first is to reassert and define the scope of the guiding principles that must govern the space activities of States or private actors, to which France is committed. These are, firstly, freedom of access to space, followed by the peaceful and responsible i.e. not deliberately aggressive  use of space13.  The legal"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,25,"framework for our action must also be robust. International law applies to space, notably the United Nations Charter which governs States right to use self-defence against armed aggression. The responses to unfriendly, wrongful or aggressive acts must be defined in accordance with the categorisations determined by international law. The guidelines that France will follow in this matter are as follows:-  France reserves the right to take retaliatory measures against an unfriendly act in space;-  France may take counter-measures in response to a wrongful act perpetrated against it with the sole purpose of bringing that act to an end, in compliance with its obligations under international law, such counter-measures being strictly necessary and proportionate to the objective pursued; -  in the event of armed aggression in space, France may avail itself of its right of self-defence. These principles of action must be backed up by an in-depth strategic and political dialogue with our European and transatlantic partners and closer cooperation with our allies, especially in terms of capabilities. We must also work more closely with our commercial partners in order to make our space capabilities more resilient and guarantee the continuity of the missions they enable us to perform. 13  Taking future orbital services as an example, whether or not they are peaceful will depend not on the systems themselves but on how they are used. 2.1.1.3  International actionFrance will continue to give its full backing, in the relevant multilateral forums14, to the pragmatic and effective regulation of space, with a particular"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,26,"focus on standards of behaviour in order to ensure strategic stability and avoid possibilities for misunderstandings or escalation.Other nations have put forward initiatives to prevent the deployment of weapons in space15. France shares the concerns expressed by several of its partners with regard to the effectiveness of such initiatives, especially the difficulty of defining what constitutes a weapon in space and monitoring the enforcement of rules on non-deployment. It therefore gives preference to pragmatic proposals that can be put into effect immediately. In particular, France could support the promotion of a norm prohibiting actions that create pieces of long-lived debris. A common definition of acts likely to constitute a threat in and from space, rules on States exposure to international responsability and responses permitted by international law will also be necessary.In this context, French actors in both the public and the private sector must continue to act in interstate and non-governmental forums to promote responsible behaviour and best practices and contribute to the development of international standards. 2.1.2  Adapt the domestic legal framework to match our ambition  Until the end of the 20th century, the State controlled all space activities carried out in France or with its help. That grip has gradually been relaxed against a background of growing diversification and privatisation. The need to regulate space activities became urgent in the early 2000s in order to ensure that France would not incur responsability and liability for operations over which the State did not exercise effective control16. 14  COPUOS, First Committee and Disarmament"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,27,"Conference. 15  Cf. in particular the Russian and Chinese proposal for a legally binding treaty (Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space - PPWT). 16  See also 1.1.2. 28 29SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019The Space Operations Act addresses this issue by establishing a requirement of prior authorisation of space operations by the civilian authority17, but it is ill-suited to military operations. Interministerial consultations will have to take place over the period 2019-2025 in order to adjust and update the domestic legal framework.The surge in private-sector activities in segments that have national security implications (other than Earth observation, already factored in) also militates in favour of an extension of the existing system of prior declaration and appraisal. However, any such adaptation of domestic law will have to strive to maintain the balance between protecting the fundamental interests of the nation and maintaining the competitiveness of the defence technological and industrial base (DTIB).Lastly, the intrinsic dual nature of the space sector and the need to develop formal partnerships with enterprises endowed with resources that may contribute to the substitution, resilience or redundancy of the armed forces legacy systems encourage the definition and promotion of the notion of trusted operator, on the basis of criteria such as availability, the integrity of the data provided and confidentiality.2.2  Grasp opportunities to build up our strategic autonomy2.2.1  Take advantage of the disruptive technologies and uses associated with New Space 2.2.1.1  The space component: satellites and constellationsSupplementing existing or programmed equipment,"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,28,"the armed forces must also take advantage of the uses and services proposed and promised by New Space, mentioned earlier. The potential opportunities that seem to be opening up must be explored with determination. The overall model that is beginning to emerge gives a glimpse of how New Space methods and technologies may coexist with those that have driven the space sector until 17  The ministry responsible for space, currently the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, after appraisal by CNES. now. The aim must be to make the most of each approach while preserving specifically military requirements.2.2.1.2  Downstream: mass data processingUsing computers instead of people to analyse space imagery was unimaginable even a few years ago. But the situation is changing quickly and algorithms can now give good results after a necessary learning (data analysis) phase.Given the long-term constraints on human resources and the increase in the amount of available data, the automatic analysis of space imagery by self-learning algorithms is thus becoming a major issue for the Armed Forces Ministry. In responding to this challenge, artificial intelligence is an essential tool for processing mass space data.2.2.1.3  New launch optionsThe cost of placement in orbit is still a key parameter of the space launch industry.SpaceX has radically changed the commercial playing field with its Falcon reusable launchers and an efficient industrial model based in particular on proximity to the launch pad and assembly facilities. It thus calls into question the position of the legacy players in the industry just as new"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,29,"entrants are on the point of offering their own launch solutions.ArianeGroup, a long-standing player in the French space industry, is developing the Ariane 6 project, due to come into service in 2020. Designed to guarantee an independent European launch capability for the years to come, the launcher will be viable only if European countries commit to using it for their institutional launches. The Armed Forces Ministry supports Ariane 6 as a guarantor of strategic autonomy.Rideshare opportunities for light satellites on conventional launchers is another avenue for consolidation18.18  This is the idea behind ESAs L3 initiative (Light satellite, Low-cost Launch opportunity), which aims to provide a low-cost launch service for small satellites on either Ariane 6 or Vega. 30 31SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019Small launchers aim to provide a light-satellite launch service that is more responsive than the service offered by conventional launch operators. Consolidation may be expected in the sector, resulting in a number of viable operators. That is why the armed forces will consider the option of using quick-launch capacity, suited to small satellites.2.2.2  Rethink our industrial model 2.2.2.1  Consolidate our DTIBThe issues at stake in maintaining a European space industry, for both civilian and military purposes, are autonomous access to and use of space (launchers and satellites respectively).Around 16,000 people are directly employed in the space industry in France, which generated consolidated sales of 4.6 billion in 2017, mostly in the civilian, commercial and institutional sector (CNES, ESA). Defence continues to be a key driver of"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,30,"innovation,  however, contributing to the state-backed R&T still needed to keep the players operating in the sector competitive.Frances space sector is mature, spanning the full range of skills from satellite design and construction to launch and operation. Fully integrated into the European space industry, from which it is now indissociable, it has two elements, satellites and launchers, each with its own specific ecosystem.The major industrial players have gained high-level expertise and achieved commercial success on the back of the institutional funding that has supported the industrys growth. However, two factors cast a shadow over this very positive picture: New Space, which is profoundly changing the industrial ecosystem, and the potential return to the global marketplace of major American players that have hitherto focused exclusively on their domestic market.2.2.2.2  The satellite industryThe industrial landscape in France is dominated by two major Franco-European contractors, Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space, offering the advantages of an independent industry in a key defence sector.Many players around the world are now well advanced in the manufacture and marketing of very small satellites, a crucial New Space technology. France lags behind, however, despite having the start-ups, SMEs and intermediate-size companies which should enable it to quickly catch up. Investment is needed in this promising sector19.In addition to making satellites, the space industry must also provide a real set of telecommunications and space observation services so that resources can be pooled and the overall resilience of the defence system enhanced. Central government can help to keep companies competitive by"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,31,"offering services which complement the industrial offering. Any excess capacity, such as legacy bandwidth, could be returned to the market where appropriate.The duplication of industrial skills is another feature of Europes space satellite industry. Judicious rationalisation or merger on a continental scale would give our industry decisive advantages on the global market for both satellites and the related services.2.2.2.3  LaunchersThe European launcher industry, under the aegis of ESA, is based on ArianeGroup and Avio (Italy), which make the Ariane and Vega launchers respectively, and a commercial operator, Arianespace, which operates them from the assembly and launch base at the Guiana Space Centre. The international launcher industry is highly subsidised via mainly closed institutional markets. The European market is an exception, since it is open to competition from non-European launchers, which some countries use for their institutional launches. Be that as it may, the preservation of our autonomous access to space currently 19  For example, France is helping Hemeria to develop a national nano-satellite industry. 32 33SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019depends on the long-term sustainability of the European launcher Ariane, the future of which will inevitably involve some cost-cutting.2.2.2.4  Keeping the lead in technologyCutting-edge space technologies are eminently dual-use, having important, specifically military implications. Key areas for defence are nano-satellites and constellations, the digitisation of satellite platforms and payloads, optical technologies, technologies which offer operational superiority and those which contribute to the resilience of our operational systems, and orbital services technologies.For the sector to increase its operational autonomy and"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,32,"export more, certain critical components currently sourced from outside Europe and subject to export restrictions must be financed at national or European level.2.2.3  Extend cooperation to space operations and open it up to new partners French military space cooperation over the last 20 years or so has focused mainly on exchanges of capabilities with European partners.In future it will also apply to space operations, an area in which the US remains a key partner.The risks to which our capabilities are exposed (cf. 1.2.3) also imply the need, in close cooperation with our allies, to increase redundancy in order to improve resilience.2.2.3.1  With our European partnersWe must seek to share a common vision of the strategic challenges of space with those European partners that are willing and able to do so. That common vision must relate first and foremost to threats in space, our policy and strategy for dealing with them and European autonomy as a goal. It must also be oriented towards the construction of a European space industry founded on mutually agreed dependencies.GermanyWithin Europe, Germany is an essential partner for a more ambitious approach to defence and security. It is therefore crucial to consolidate our relationship in space matters.Bilateral cooperation is underpinned by observation, in the form of exchanges of French optical and German radar data (Helios and SAR-Lupe now, CSO and SARah in due course). It could be extended in the future to space situational awareness, with the ultimate aim of sharing a coordinated and autonomous spatial situation20. The advantage of such"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,33,"cooperation is self-evident for low-orbit surveillance, since Frances GRAVES radar and its successor (cf. 3.3.2.1) and Germanys GESTRA surveillance and tracking radar offer complementary capabilities. New areas of cooperation in relation to observation may be sought and will be pursued, especially in the framework of appraisal of the future Optical Space Component programme (a military Earth observation programme).ItalyItaly is Frances second most important space partner. Historically, our cooperation has concerned exchanges of observation data (optical on the part of France, radar on the part of Italy) and the development of shared telecommunications satellites, both military (SICRAL 2) and dual-use (ATHENA-FIDUS). UKThere are possibilities for cooperation on space operations with the UK, along with the United States and other partner countries.2.2.3.2  The European UnionSpace has been an area of shared competence between the EU and Member States since the Lisbon Treaty came into force in 2009. EU space programmes have been exclusively civilian to date, 20  The conclusions of the French-German Defence and Security Council meeting in July 2017 stated that France and Germany [] agree to cooperate on military space surveillance capabilities in order to share a coordinated spatial situation. 34 35SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019albeit with security-related aspects. The EU could earmark up to 16 billion between 2021 and 2027 for two main programmes, the Copernicus Earth observation system and the Galileo positioning, navigation and timing system. Only limited resources are assigned to the other two programmes, EUSST and GovSatcom.Looking beyond current projects, a space Europe is needed"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,34,"in order to make a direct contribution to the construction of a Defence Europe and the continents security. To this end, the French-German axis mentioned earlier must help to draw energies together, especially around a broad-based European SSA project.The new European Defence Fund (EDF) could also help to finance specifically security-related space capabilities, with a governance system better suited to the requirements of defence programmes than that of the EU space programme. The duplication of industrial skills must be avoided.2.2.3.3 NATOAt the Brussels Summit in July 2018, the NATO countries recognised the growing importance of space in the strategic and operational environment and decided to frame an overall NATO space policy that would help the allies achieve a more comprehensive and coherent understanding of space issues. There is no call for NATO to develop its own space capabilities, but it can use those made available by its members, who retain sovereign control over them. 2.2.3.4  With our partners outside Europe United StatesThe US plays a central role in SSA, since the Space Track system benefits all space satellite operators. Cooperation with the US in this particular area must continue even as technological advances enable Europe to develop its own capabilities, making it a credible partner.The US is also a key ally for our military space operations.  India  The strategic partnership with India and long-standing cooperation in the civilian space sphere, especially launchers, will be strengthened.Japan  Our space cooperation with Japan, structured since 2016 by a comprehensive dialogue on space under the aegis"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,35,"of the SGDSN (Secretariat General for Defence and National Security), is being stepped up, especially in space surveillance.Canada and Australia  France has long maintained a structural partnership with Australia, a front-line strategic player in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia aims to expand its space sector, with which synergies must be sought.The same applies to Canada, another important player in the space sector.3  ROADMAPIn order to guarantee Frances capacity to act in space, the armed forces must (i) strengthen a space doctrine which establishes the ground rules for and typology of military space operations, (ii) overhaul military space governance, and (iii) ensure that they have appropriate capabilities and human resources.3.1  Strengthen French space defence doctrine3.1.1  Military space operations Military space operations span all activities carried out by or for the Armed Forces Ministry in, from and towards space in order to ensure the availability, tracking, safety and security of national or national-interest space capabilities and services and hence preserve our freedom of discretion, access and action in that domain.36 37SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019Military space operations consist in operating space capabilities21  that provide services22 in support of government authorities and military operations, thus helping to increase the effectiveness of action. They contribute to national security, the robustness of our economy and protection of the population. They also include action taken in space to protect our assets and discourage any aggression.They are organised around four functions:-  space service support;-  space situational awareness;-  operations support; - "
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,36,"active space defence.3.1.1.1  Space service supportThis function concerns the deployment, implementation and availability of space capabilities. Of the four functions of military  space operations, it is the one with the most pronounced dual-use character. It includes the following operations:-  launch and placement; -  launch-pad implementation (currently the Guiana Space Centre);  -  keeping satellites in service and in orbit (functions not performed to date by the armed forces for themselves);  -  reconstitution of capabilities (restoring, compensating for or replacing a diminished or missing capability, including the possible use of complementary allied or commercial capabilities).Space service support is a necessary though not sufficient condition for France to keep its status as a space power. The armed forces are thus directly concerned by foreseeable changes to launcher policy in France, and by the future of the Guiana Space Centre.21  Ground segments, means of transmission and control, space segments, operational resources, skilled personnel. 22  Observation, signals intelligence, communications, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT). 3.1.1.2  Space situational awareness  Control of space situational awareness (SSA) is a prerequisite for the commercial exploitation of space and the conduct of military operations of all kinds.SSA supplements and interprets information provided by space surveillance and tracking (SST), producing a recognised space picture (RSP). It requires capabilities that guarantee a certain level of strategic autonomy, now partly provided in France by the GRAVES system. SSA meets three distinct needs:-  assessment of the threats that adversary space systems can pose to our satellites, our"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,37,"territory or our forces in the field. SSA is thus essential in order to attribute an internationally wrongful act to a State and permit an appropriate response;-  prevention of risks of collision in space between active satellites and other objects, ensured mainly by SST. While the need to prevent collision is more restrictive than the military need in terms of the size of objects to be detected (very small pieces of debris), it requires neither the same responsiveness nor the same level of national autonomous appraisal, thus offering opportunities for cooperation, especially with European and American partners;-  coordination with other space actors, especially in relation to unintentional jamming.SSA should therefore be understood as the foundation of military space operations23. 3.1.1.3  Operations supportThis function involves the implementation and operation of payloads (on space platforms) which contribute to the following joint-services functions:-  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); 23  It lays the foundation for (i) protecting our territory and population, (ii) ensuring compliance with international agreements and treaties, (iii) guaranteeing the security of space manoeuvres, (iv) protecting space capabilities, (v) guaranteeing the continuity of military space activities, and (vi) providing the armed forces with the information needed to plan and carry out their operations. 38 39SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019-  early warning and launch tracking; -  surveillance of the geographical, physical and human environment;  -  satellite communications (SATCOM);  -  positioning, navigation and timing (PNT).Corresponding to the way in which the armed forces currently"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,38,"use space, space support to operations will continue to be enhanced.3.1.1.4  Active space defenceMilitary space operations, previously Earth-centred, must now also be directed towards space and seek under all circumstances to:-  preserve freedom of access to and action in space;-  discourage and thwart action by any ill-intentioned third party.They span various passive and active measures relating to:-  prevention, taking a comprehensive approach (diplomatic, media, economic, legal, etc.);-  the resilience of all space assets;-  the defence in space of our space assets.3.1.2  Frame the doctrine for the conduct of space operationsWithin the framework established for military space operations, the armed forces must establish a body of doctrine which incorporates changes in the space sector and the following fundamental principles:-  autonomous assessment and decision-taking;-  France as a driver of the space sector in Europe; -  the means to defend our capabilities and ensure compliance with international law, including self-defence.To ensure coherence and interoperability, the positions of Frances allies and partners with regard to space operations will be taken into consideration when French doctrine is framed, as will feedback from training and exercises carried out with them within NATO or other frameworks24. The consideration given to the work carried out by allied States, plus monitoring of the posture of our potential adversaries, are factors which reflect the inevitability of cooperation in space: France cannot act alone in that domain, especially if there is a general deterioration of the situation. The aim is therefore to contribute to the consolidation of"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,39,"an allied military space community, which could include the industrial sector as necessary.3.1.3  Evaluate the threats affecting our space capabilities We need a robust evaluation of the threats we face in order to conduct our operations and help us define our capability requirements. Understanding how a potential adversary can act in space means knowing their doctrine, their capabilities and their willingness to use them.This space threat assessment must be backed up by better use of available data, especially images.3.1.4  Enhance our armed forces capability to operate without space support    As we have seen, access to and use of space for national defence and security purposes are of strategic importance and must be protected in order to contribute to the armed forces resilience and freedom of action.Nonetheless, the almost systematic use of space capabilities also raises the issue of a state of dependence which the armed forces must, if necessary, be able to partially surmount in order to conti-nue to carry out their operations25. The armed forces must therefore seek to make space services re-silient, first and foremost through cooperation that will ensure the redundancy of space assets, but also through complementarity 24  Combined Space Operations or Schriever Wargames. 25  Without satellites the armed forces would be partially blinded, being deprived of essential operational capabilities (cf. supra). 40 41SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019with non-space systems. They will have to maintain capabilities and nurture skills that will enable them to accomplish their mis-sions in conditions where"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,40,"space support has deteriorated. Setting up an exercise in which the use of space assets was ruled out or restricted would be one way of studying the consequences of a deterioration of space services and would help to expand the range of alternative solutions.3.2  Adapt military space governance to our ambitions3.2.1  Reorganise the chain of command for space assets within the Armed Forces Ministry in order to achieve our ambitionsThe Joint Space Command (Commandement Interarmes de lEspace, CIE), created under the Chief of the Defence Staff in 2010, was tasked with framing and implementing military space policy, including the identification of military space capability requirements and the command of those capabilities. Its current responsibilities include operational expertise and weapons programmes, the coordination of international cooperation in space matters and the coordination of military space capabilities used by various units under separate chains of command.Features of the current situation include the fragmentation of effective responsibility for the framing of military space policy, the geographical and functional dispersal of military space facilities and players, and the absence of a single chain of command for space operations.The Armed Forces Ministrys new ambition implies an overhaul of the current organisation in line with the principles of joint operational efficiency, coherence, visibility and simplicity. Without impinging on the Chief of the Defence Staffs responsibilities for operations and military planning, the new organisation will need the necessary resources to deal with issues relating to capabilities, human resources, the legal framework, interministerial coordination and international cooperation.Studies of a revision of the"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,41,"governance system concur that this mission should be entrusted to the Air Force as the only service capable of supporting the constitution of a pool of expertise and guaranteeing the career paths needed to make space an attractive choice. This option also preserves the priority given to operations under the aegis of the Defence Staff while addressing the issues of visibility and coherence. To enhance that visibility, the Air Force will be renamed the Air and Space Force.Ambition will thus become reality as an approach based on operational support, implemented at different levels under different commands, becomes an approach which recognises space as a domain in its own right, with the same status as the other domains of engagement. Two major factors will ensure overall coherence within this framework:-  the greater consideration given to space at central level,-  the creation of a specific component.This choice will be implemented as soon as possible, ensuring a transition phase that will guarantee the continuity of our operations in space. The creation of a specific entity based on the current Joint Space Command will be the necessary preliminary step to this reconfiguration.  3.2.2  Rethink the relationship between the Armed Forces Ministry and CNES The Armed Forces Ministry exercises joint oversight over CNES with the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, reflected in the fact, for example, that the head of defence procurement is responsible for Programme 191, dual (civilian and military) research26.  3.2.2.1  Management of programmesCNES is systematically involved in the conduct of"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,42,"major military space programmes. Drawing on CNESs past experience with space26  It has a budget of 180 million, of which 150 million is devoted to actions with a defence interest carried out by CNES (dual research in aerospace). 42 43SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 programmes such as Helios, Spot CSO, CERES and Pliades, the defence procurement agency (DGA) shares its contracting-authority role with CNES according to the operational area concerned:-  in optical observation, CNES is the delegated contracting authority for the CSO programme because of its expertise in that field;-  in electromagnetic surveillance, the DGA is the contracting authority for the CERES programme;-  in telecommunications, the DGA remains the contracting authority, drawing extensively on the industrial contractor for the Syracuse programme, given that the industry in this sector is mature.The DGA has also formed integrated programme teams with CNES. They track progress on military space programmes, and decisions are taken jointly.Nevertheless, consideration must now also be given to the level of maturity achieved by French industry, whose commercial activity often outstrips their institutional activity. Contractors should be allowed greater responsibility. Such a move will both free up expertise and help to focus it on innovative areas requiring substantial investment in research and technology (R&T). Lastly, the Armed Forces Ministry and CNES will have to establish a closer relationship, taking into account the changes to the Ministrys internal governance. The arrangements for steering that relationship will have to be examined jointly by the armed forces, the DGA and"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,43,"CNES with the aim of producing proposals for renewal.3.2.2.2 Management of operationsCNES is responsible for operating legacy military satellites with the exception of Syracuse satellites (see above). In that capacity it is responsible for the ground control segment. Given the changing nature of military space operations, the armed forces will have to acquire the necessary skills to operate space objects themselves.3.2.2.3 Clarify financial resourcesAt the same time as managing programmes, CNES and DGA prepare technologies for the next generation of satellites. Military superiority implies effective resources using the most innovative solutions (commercial, technological or uses).Three resources are essential for optimum management of future programmes:-  rich and abundant forward-looking R&T financed by the Armed Forces Ministry and CNES;-  a line of demonstrators to pave the way for the technologies or concepts of the future and, if necessary, consolidate the technologies earmarked for future projects;-  a mature industry to manage development on a fixed-price basis.As space technologies are dual-use and investment in projects helps to strengthen the industrial fabric, these initiatives form part of the CoSpace policy introduced by the defence, economy and research ministers in 2013.The CNES Defence team, comprising members of the EMA, DGA and CNES, is responsible for guiding the choices to be made, especially as regards the financing split between P144 and P191. In the specific case of research, the DGA also carries out programmes under P144 for the Armed Forces Ministry and has an agreement with CNES, renewed in 2016, which provides for exchanges of common research programmes and working"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,44,"groups on subjects of joint interest.CNESs R&T programme aims more broadly to improve the effectiveness of telecommunication and observation systems, their onboard intelligence (processors and flight software) and all the building-block technologies for satellite platforms. Most of these generic activities have a considerable dual-use interest 27, which should give CNESs activities in the military sphere greater visibility.27  In 2016 and 2017, for example, 85% of CNES Orbital Systems R&T programme qualified as dual-use. 44 45SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  20193.2.2.4  Strategic and organisational aspectsThe Armed Forces Ministry expresses its research options and priorities through its oversight of CNES (exercised jointly with the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation) and ONERA. These two bodies have internal organisational arrangements which take those options and priorities into account and reflect them in the management of programmes and operations.3.3  Develop space capabilities in reponse to our ambitionsThe use of space resources will range from support for operations on Earth to operations in space in order to defend the capabilities deployed there.Although a balance will be sought between assets and services for each segment of the space resource, the identification and characterisation capabilities that require the validation and interpretation of data must form part of the assets or trusted partnerships, strictly regulated in legal terms in the event of the use of services.3.3.1  Secure space operational support capabilities in the long termThe first priority of space strategy is to enhance the capabilities already used to support land, sea and air operations. The"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,45,"aim is thus  to upgrade and secure the long-term sustainability of the observation, signals intelligence, space communications and geographical positioning capabilities already available to the armed forces.The first challenge concerns the intelligence cycle, which needs to be accelerated by reducing satellite response times and facilitating the provision of data collected in theatres of operations. That will require a capability for automatic or on-demand dissemination of images or videos to several users. Artificial intelligence will also play a major role in the processing of mass data gathered in space: the armed forces will be confronted with a data wall. Processing and automatic object detection require vast and pooled storage capacity, suitable algorithms and substantial computing power. The use of trusted operators in this area should not be ruled out.Space signals intelligence may be enhanced by other capabilities, especially in the sphere of maritime surveillance and geopositioning.Space capabilities will also have to meet the challenge of the armed forces need for greater connectivity, especially in the air (Rafale F4, drones, FCAS project), on land (the Scorpion programme) and at sea (PANG, the new-generation aircraft carrier), which requires a significant increase in voice communication and data transfer capacities due to the proliferation of connected players and faster data flows.In order to enhance the resilience and responsiveness of their operations, the armed forces will have to study ways of ensuring the continuity of space services for their benefit. That could include tactical satellite launch capabilities. New Space technologies such as nano-satellites, cluster launches and even mini-launchers seem to point"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,46,"towards such a possibility. HAPS (high-altitude pseudo-satellites) are another option for exploration.3.3.2  Prioritise the development of an SSA capability Space situational awareness, a pillar of the planned strategy, contributes to the protection of space capabilities. It has three components: surveillance, space-related intelligence and environmental data. It also needs to be backed up by a robust command and control system (C2).3.3.2.1 SurveillanceThe first component of SSA, surveillance has three functions in relation to objects: detection, tracking and characterisation/identification. It must be supplemented by permanent tracking of space launches and objects placed in orbit. This end-to-end tracking contributes to the attribution of an ill-intentioned or hostile act.Ground-based detection and trackingVarious technologies are used to detect objects from the ground, depending on their altitude. -  Low Earth orbits (less than 2,000 km)46 47SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019Frances GRAVES radar is an essential component of its space surveillance system. Its renovation in 2022 will extend its working life and improve its effectiveness.However, construction of the successor to GRAVES will be brought forward, with a first capability increment in 2025, in order to bring the capability to track new objects of interest (especially debris, as mentioned earlier) into service as soon as possible.Forming the basis for our low Earth orbit SST architecture, the post-GRAVES capability will be a national asset. It may be strengthened by bilateral cooperation with Germany or draw on the EUSST initiative (though it has not given full satisfaction to date) or some other European financing arrangement such as the European"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,47,"Defence Fund or EDIDP.SATAM radars for tracking objects in low orbit will be renovated under MPA 2019-2025, with a replacement scheduled for 2030. European cooperation, especially with Germany, or even the purchase of a ground- or space-based service should be among the options to be considered. -  Medium and geostationary orbitsA state service and a commercial service currently provide geostationary orbit monitoring and tracking. This configuration, using telescopes shared with private- or public-sector civilian operators, provides feedback which can then inform thinking about the acquisition strategy (national asset, cooperation and service).The planned upgrades to existing GEO monitoring and tracking systems should enable MEO monitoring and tracking in the near future.Ground-based characterisation and identificationThe need is for a resilient system based on:-  sovereign satellite radar imagery capabilities. Cooperation with Germany should be sought, in addition to any national assets;-  telescopes with adaptive optics in order to obtain high-re-solution images of objects in low Earth orbit.Using a cross-cutting approach to these different aspects of SSA, the planned architectures and resources must take advantage of the Armed Forces Ministrys bases in overseas France, since their geographical position offers natural options for optimisation in relation to orbits and objects detected.SSA from spaceThe resources described above correspond to a ground-based system which will have to be subsequently extended to include additional resources in orbit. Observation of space from space, whether for the purposes of detection, tracking, characterisation or identification, helps to get closer to the objects to be observed.3.3.2.2 Command and control system (C2)These surveillance assets are building"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,48,"blocks of systems that need to be used in parallel by including them in the military space operations command and control system in order to control their definition and the appropriate levels of confidentiality and sovereignty.3.3.2.3 Space-related intelligenceSpace-related intelligence concerns the characteristics, performance and status of space objects and the capacity of other States to interfere with our national interests in space.It is prepared by the ministrys intelligence operatives, drawing on all available resources (national sensors or intelligence-sharing with partners).3.3.2.4 Space environment dataAn essential complement to SSA, this mainly comprises space meteorological data. Synergy will be sought with the services offered by the European Union. The data will contribute to assessment of the issues associated with making our space assets more resilient to space risks of natural origin.48 49SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  20193.3.3  Protecting and hardening our space capabilities  From the outset, the development of any weapons system incorporates a detailed analysis of threats and how they may change, from which appropriate measures to protect against them are deduced. Military space systems are no exception: their development currently incorporates protection against potential threats from Earth (electromagnetic aggression, cyber-attack, high-altitude nuclear explosion). They must therefore systematically incorporate responses to emerging threats in space.The first measure to protect our satellites is based on detailed space situational awareness, considered earlier.Plans are already in hand for the protection of future defence satellites (Syracuse IV, CERES and CSO). Additional measures must be taken where relevant in order to make them more resilient.In the longer"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,49,"term, technological initiatives will be taken in order to harden the future generation of satellites.Observation of the close environment of satellites may also help to strengthen their protection. Capabilities of this type will be implemented on board the Syracuse 4A and 4B satellites in order to detect any approach by another satellite.3.3.4  Acquire a capability to defend our interestsIn order to be able to implement Frances space defence strategy and better protect our space capabilities (know and act), it is crucial to give the armed forces the capabilities to defend us in space.  Studies and demonstrators over the period of the Military  Planning ActEarmarking over 3.6 billion for space, MPA 2019-2025 must provide the armed forces over the period with initial capabilities that enable them to carry out operations in space.A long-term capability by 2030The efforts made under MPA 2019-2025 must be the springboard for full capability by 2030.These capabilities will be integrated, as sensors and effectors, into the scope of the future military space operations command and control system, the initial studies for which will begin as of MPA 2019-20253.3.5  Contribute to ballistic missile defence (BMD)3.3.5.1  ContextThe threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles is an established fact among both State and non-state actors. The appearance of terminally guided ballistic missiles, which are much more accurate than conventional missiles, will expose the armed forces to a greater threat. 3.3.5.2  State of playBallistic missile defence is based on three types of capability:-  early warning (surveillance and detection by"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,50,"satellite and/or radar depending on the missiles range);-  a command and control system to coordinate information, estimate the impact zone and decide on interception;-  interception capabilities (radar guidance and interceptor missiles).NATO members concern for territorial missile defence was addressed through the NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme and policy at the Lisbon Summit in 2010, complementing the Alliances existing Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence (TBMD). The programme is based on voluntary national contributions, with only command and control being jointly financed. The US is the only power to date with a comprehensive set of territorial BMD resources.Frances contribution to NATOs BMD capabilities is currently based on the SAMP/T land-based medium-range air defence system.50 51SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019In addition to SAMP/T, in the 2008 Defence and National Security White Paper France stated its intention of acquiring an early warning capability. This need, reasserted within NATO after the decisions taken at the 2010 Lisbon Summit, also features in the 2017 Strategic Review, which identified early warning as a capability to be enhanced.3.3.5.3  OutlookA comprehensive early warning capability draws on complementary space- and ground-based components. For the ground-based aspect, the armed forces have the very long range radar demonstrator handed over in 2016 and currently undergoing trials.For the space-based component, the SPIRALE space demonstrator was operated in orbit between 2009 and 2011.3.4  Develop space defence expertiseThe growing importance of space also implies a significant human resources element, involving the cultivation of expertise based on three pillars:-  a training resource,"
0,France Space Defence Strategy 2019,51,"the space academy, which coordinates existing training and is open to other ministries and our foreign partners, providing high-level training leading to recognised qualifications;-  specific, varied and well-rewarded career paths from initial recruitment to senior managerial positions;-  an outreach strategy to give the service the necessary long-term visibility, recognition and attractiveness.3.4.1  A training resource: the space academyThe space academy will nurture space defence expertise and enhance skills at all functional levels. It will act as the ministrys training expert for space.Initial space training will give recruits or staff already working in the area a core knowledge base and nurture the ministrys space community. A necessary first step, it will be supplemented by the introduction of a training path adapted to each individuals functional level and area of expertise.Targeted training opportunities will be identified, ranging from short conversion courses to specialist masters degrees within various institutions, especially elite engineering schools under ministry oversight, and provided according to needs and career paths. The academy will coordinate all the training offered.The space academys expertise and training courses will be open to partners from other ministries and other countries, especially to support exports of space systems, and to other stakeholders in the sector (CNES, ONERA, industrial firms, other EU Member States, etc.). It may be a prime forum for exchanges and encounters with academic and industrial players in the space sector, with the particular aim of encouraging innovation.

That role will be taken by the employer, in liaison with other managers, especially the armed forces, the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DRM) and the Joint Directorate of Infrastructure Networks and Information Systems (DIRISI).52 53SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019For officers, the creation of a Space specialisation at the Air Force Academy in Salon-de-Provence will provide the necessary structure within the armed forces. The annual intake for the specialisation will include career officers, contract officers and category A civilian personnel with scientific or space expertise. Opportunities for transfers will enable officers from other specialisations to join the sector.Non-commissioned officers and category B civilian personnel may continue their career within the space sector or return to their original specialisation.3.4.3  Greater visibility, recognition and attractivenessThe creation of a space family within the ministerial employment opportunities template will offer greater visibility and provide significant leverage in order to build up the sector. Positions of interest for space within the ministry will be specially flagged up.ANNEXESANNEX 1  MEMBERSHIP OF THE WORKING GROUPANNEX 2  ABBREVIATIONS54 55SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019 SPACE DEFENCE STRATEGY  2019ANNEX 1MEMBERSHIP OF THE"

With this in mind, the new Objectives and Performance Contract (OPC) signed with our overseeing ministries for 2022-2025 is founded on four pillars: sovereignty, i.e. France and Europes strategic independence; scientific cooperation, working to project Frances influence; climate; and economic competitiveness, bringing new players into the fold to make Frances space industry more competitive.The new OPC also puts the emphasis on changing how we work. Over the next four years, we must achieve more subsidiarity and agility in everything we do, while taking the benefits of our actions to a broader base and enhancing our technical skillset. These changes will enable CNES to refocus its efforts on missions that deliver high added value and on disruptive innovation.04With France and Europes strategic independence"
0,France CNES Policy 2022,2,"one of the key stakes of the new OPC, what is CNESs strategy to strengthen our national sovereignty in an increasingly complex global environment?Guaranteeing Frances and more broadly Europes  independent access to space is how we will strengthen  our national sovereignty. Our first goal in this regard is to get Ariane 6 off the ground and ensure its future commercial  success. We must also lay plans for the future by starting work on the launchers of tomorrow, notably reusable launchers with the lowest possible operating costs, while making the Guiana Space Centre the worlds leading spaceport. Strengthening national sovereignty also implies supporting the ramp-up  of our military space capability.What role does CNES have to play addressing growing concerns about climate change and social issues?As a government agency, CNES has a clear corporate social and  environmental responsibility. Weve set out a CSR strategy aligned with the United Nations Agenda 2030 and Frances roadmap  for attaining the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This strategy commits us to curbing our environmental footprint, preserving biodiversity and fostering greater gender equality at all levels  of management.Were also engaging our efforts through projects delivering ever more data vital to support work on biodiversity and climate science. Space is the thermometer of our planet and an effective way to tackle the issue of global warming that concerns us all.Riding on the momentum from the historic launch of  the James Webb Space T elescope at the end of last year, 2022 is set to see a wealth"
0,France CNES Policy 2022,3,"of scientific projects and joint missions. What areas of cooperation do you intend to focus on in the years ahead?First of all, I want to congratulate all of the teams at CNES and our partners for the successful launch of JWST by Ariane 5 last 25 December from the Guiana Space Centre. The precision of the launch has already extended Webbs service life by several years before it even starts operating. I want CNES to continue structuring partnerships vital to space science: at national level, by maintaining close ties with the entire French ecosystem, from research laboratories and industry to ministries, local  government and start-ups; at European level, by continuing  to lead Frances contribution to the European Space Agencys science programme; and at international level, by pursuing development of the strategic projects engaged by our many partners in space. Were hearing a lot right now about returning to the Moon and later possibly sending crewed missions to Mars.  What role should Europe and in particular CNES be playing in these new ambitions?Thomas Pesquets ISS missions and the leading space  powers projects to build bases on the Moon and possibly Mars are fantastic for the space sectors visibility. CNES is enabling France to play a key role in these endeavours through ESAs European Exploration Envelope Programme (E3P), which affords regular flight opportunities to the ISS and in the near future to the Gateway or the lunar surface. Europes project must be inspired by this conquering spirit of space exploration, which is why "
0,France CNES Policy 2022,4,"developing human spaceflight missions in Europe is something that merits being reconsidered.Since taking the helm at CNES youve emphasized  the new challenge of exploiting space data. Can you set out your vision in more detail?Space data have become an essential feature of our lives.  The space value chain is shifting further downstream with  the countless services were supplying to industry and citizens. Be it for research, business or the environment, digital and space technologies will be driving growth in the years ahead.  We must therefore nurture and support businesses and  start-ups that need space data to invent new services.With CNES celebrating its 60th anniversary this year  and signing a new OPC with its overseeing ministries,  how does it stand between its heritage and future horizons?CNESs long history of success is something we can be proud of. In 60 years, weve cultivated a world-renowned space science community, built a European agency with our partners  federating the efforts of all and spawned manufacturers  that are today world leaders in their field. Our role today is not the same as it was in the past, and were now poised to write  a new chapter. But the common thread linking past, present  and future is our ability to work together and go the extra mile  as we serve the nation through our shared passion for space.0506CNES 2   22Sixty years ago, France formed its space agency to federate national efforts. CNES (Centre National dEtudes Spatiales) has been"

With its eye on preser-ving Europes independent access to space, notably through the Ariane programme, CNES continues to innovate in working towards cheaper and reusable future laun-chers and is poised to usher in Ariane 6, while also developing and modernizing the Guiana Space Centre. Over the years, our agency has partnered with French and Eu-ropean research laboratories and manufac-turers of all shapes and sizes to build scien-tific excellence, strategic independence and economic competitiveness for the nation and for Europe. Thanks to our vigorous cooperation policy and solid tech-nical expertise, CNES has succeeded in cultivating a space ecosystem of excellence in France. Through the syner-gies thus created, we have achieved major world firsts and  developed vital tools to address issues shaping the future such as climate change, health and safety, while also advan-cing knowledge and furthering human deep-space explora-tion. Our role is therefore to contribute through our topflight skills to our ecosystem so that it can innovate, prepare us for the changes ahead and keep pace with in-ternational competitors in the fast-moving New Space arena. For six decades now, CNES has paved the way for applications and new uses of space.

The Federal Governments new space strategy reflects the importance of this sector for the future of our country. Our space strategy therefore focuses on the benefits that space technology can bring to the Earth and society. Our motto is Into space for the benefit of humankind.  The space sector needs to face up to competition from other fields of technology and will be measured by whether the resources spent on it can be expected to produce appropriate scientific, societal or commer-cial benefits. In this context, basic research plays a major role as it lays the foundation for this to happen.

Introduction: setting the stage for Germanys space strategyThe International Space Station is the largest international space project, a cooperation between the USA, Russia, Japan, Canada and 11 ESA mem-ber states, including Germany.A paradigm shift has occurred within space: once a symbol of the technology race and a contest between opposing systems, it is now, in every sense, a part of our everyday lives and an essential instrument for the achievement of economic, scientific, political and social goals . Today space makes a vital contribu-tion when it comes to promoting research and devel -opment, education and innovation, economic growth, providing highly qualified jobs, improving our quali -ty of life, protecting the Earth, ensuring our security and defence and furthering international coopera -tion. Space activities, as the European Commission put it in its Europe 2020 communication, provide us with the tools to address some of the key global chal-lenges. In the last decade, the German space sector has achieved a number of significant successes. Each time an Ariane launcher lifts off from the launch pad, it does so with a substantial amount of vital hardware on board made in Germany. At the same time, German satellite technology enables us to see with greater clarity what is happening on Earth and in space, while Germanys"
0,German space strategy Nov10,6,"space scientists are among the very best the world has to offer. Today, Germany can lay claim to competitive industrial and research structures in the space domain. Space activities form a central plank of the German Federal Governments high-tech policy. In the frame -work of its High-Tech Initiative, the Federal Govern -ment has increased the amount it spends on space by approximately 10  % per year. In addition to continuing our high level of contributions to ESA, the national space budget in particular has been substantially increased. The aim of promoting the continuing de  -vel opment of Germanys technological skills, partly through the countrys unique strengths in specific areas, has enabled Germany, both within ESA and in other international cooperation, to assume leading positions as is the case in Earth observation, for exam-ple, or in the new field of laser communications.  As we enter a new decade, the German space  sector is facing  a fresh set of challenges :3  International competition  in space is set to in  -crease. Leading spacefaring nations such as the United States, Russia, France and Japan will seek to defend their positions while, in addition, coun-tries such as China, India and South Korea are driving ahead in specific areas, thereby bringing increased competition. Against this background, Germanys space sector will be forced, more than ever, to focus on its key strengths of reliability, 4quality and price, and on those areas where tech -nologically it has something unique to offer. In this respect, SMEs have,"
0,German space strategy Nov10,7,"in addition to the large system integrators, an absolutely essential role to play.3  At the same time, the environment in Europe with regard to space has changed dramatically . In addition to ESA, the EU too is now developing its own space policy initiatives, having obtained explicit powers in this area under the Lisbon Treaty. The current major projects, Galileo (for satellite navigation) and GMES (Global Monitor  ing for Environment and Security) mark the start of EU involvement in the exploitation of space. In future, collaboration between ESA and the EU will require a clear division of roles and responsibilities.President Obamas announcement in spring 2010 on the reorientation of his countrys space activities and, in particular, the new US Space Policy point to a new set of priorities. In addition to, in future, stepping up the intensity of ISS exploitation, the United States  will strengthen its civil space development activities through ambitious technology applications and unmanned robotic research. At the same time, the United States is calling for greater international co  -operation with the aim of ensuring a safe, sustainable and peaceful exploitation of space. The new coopera-tive approach is wide-ranging and, with the exception of the launcher field, touches on all the important space science, technological and space policy themes. Europe should approach this as a constructive chal-lenge, both within joint projects as well as in competi -tion among partners. Germany, with Europes second- biggest space sector, has the opportunity to contribute its specific strengths to this endeavour.3  Both at"

Private enterprise business models are growing in importance, especially in the United States, where for some time they have been advanced systematically as a means to fulfil governmental Earth observation data needs. In the future, these models will be extended to the procurement of launch services from US commercial providers, with the addition-al aim of making commercial US launch service providers more competitive in the global market. German astronaut Hans Schlegel performing a spacewalk at the Inter -national Space Station during the Columbus mission in February 20081.  Introduction: setting the stage for Germanys space strategyWith the steady build-up of space capabilities in the emerging economies, competition is increas -ing in the global market for high technology in the space infrastructure field. 3  The dependence of many areas of our daily lives as well as governmental activities on space appli -cations makes them a potential target of hostile governmental and non-governmental entities.  As the number of spacefaring nations grows, it is also becoming increasingly clear that, for terres -trial applications, space merely appears endless, while in fact it is becoming ever more crowded. This raises new questions in areas ranging from sustainability to the regulation of access and exploitation, protection of space systems, arms control and verification.To meet these challenges, German space policy must focus even more strongly on its strategic objectives. In his August 2009 report, the Federal Govern -ment coordinator for the German aerospace industry gave an assessment of Germanys positioning"
0,German space strategy Nov10,9,"with regard to space activities and made a number of    5recommendations concerning space policy. The space strategy follows on from those recommendations. The Federal Governments space strategy pre -sents the plans and milestones already in place while also forming the basis for future German activities in space. In particular, it serves to facilitate coordination within the Federal Government and sets out guide-lines for a consistent representation of the national interest across government departments and in the international sphere. Space technologies and projects have long devel -opment cycles. Due notably to the decisions taken at the 2008 ESA ministerial conference, government funding for space in the next few years is largely tied up in ongoing projects and programmes. Our aim must be to begin setting out, as of now, the direction of travel for the period subsequent to that. The focus will not be on individual projects as such but, above all, on the general orientation and long-term strate-gic options, which must also form a central plank in the Federal Governments ongoing high-tech strategy. ESA ministerial conference in The Hague, 2008Excursus:Space 2010: the status of space activities in Germany3  In its 2006 High-Tech Strategy, the Federal Government accorded particular importance to space:  indeed, within that strategy, space is the biggest single field in financial terms. The level of funding has made it possible to consolidate Germanys role as a key location for space activities as well as its number 2 position in the European space sector (after France and ahead of Italy)."
0,German space strategy Nov10,10,"The Federal Government has thus provided the German space industry and German science with a good platform from which to now expand this position in selected areas. 3  In 2010, the Federal Government is spending about  1.2 bn on space , with about  985 m of that com -ing from the BMWi (Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology) technology budget. The BMVBS (Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development) contributes  96 m towards European meteorological satellites, and to the GMES and Galileo programmes.3  The biggest single item in German spending on space is the countrys contribution to ESA, which stands at 637m . According to ESA rules, nearly all the amounts paid in flow back to Germany in the form of contracts, thereby benefiting German firms and research facilities directly. Germany  as the second largest contributor to ESA after France  participates in ESA activities in all the key space sectors and has, as a result of its substantial contributions, come to assume the leading position in strategically important programmes such as Earth observation and satellite communications. 3  The second pillar is the National Space Programme, to which the BMWi provided  240 m in 2010 . The purpose of the national programme is to allow Germany to pursue independent objectives, especially 6 1.

In"
0,German space strategy Nov10,11,"addition, a series of complemen -tary national and bilateral activities are conducted. At the same time, the National Space Programme is a tool which, by setting strategic priorities, enables our industry to prepare for increased competition in Europes internal market.3  The German space sector boasts a number of cutting-edge research and operational facilities . Foremost among these is the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft- und Raumfahrt, or DLR), which receives institutional support from the Federal Government and the German Lnder (space budget in 2010:  151 m). DLR scientists make contributions, both technological and operational, to national and international space missions and to research projects in collaboration with partners in research and industry. In so doing, the DLR makes vital contributions to German space research. In addition, the DLR operates important test and operational facilities such as the rocket test stands at the DLR Institute for space propulsion in Lampoldshausen or the German space operations centre (GSOC) in Oberpfaffenhofen.3  The Raumfahrtmanagement (Space Administration) unit within the DLR draws up the German space  programme on behalf of the Federal Government, implements the programme, and integrates all German space activities at the national and European level.3  In addition to the DLR, Germany plays host to a number of other first-rate research centres  in the field of space-oriented research and development. This notably includes institutes and departments at a wide range of universities as well as the Max Planck Society, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, and the Helmholtz centres.3  EUMETSAT (the European Organisation for"
0,German space strategy Nov10,12,"the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) and ESAs ESOC  establishment are both located in Darmstadt. A second ESA site is the European Astronaut Centre (EAC)   in Cologne.3  With sales revenue approaching 2bn and providing roughly 6200 jobs in 2009 (figures from BDLI, the German aerospace industry association), Germany has, after France, the second biggest space industry in Europe. The bulk of these highly qualified jobs are in the system segment domain for EADS Astrium or for the OHB group.3  A particular feature of the German space industry is the large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in the development and manufacturing of subsystems and components.  It is a reflection of their high level of technological competence that they are highly sought-after partners both at home and abroad. The Federal Government attaches special importance to these firms since they frequently provide the impetus for innovation in technologies and processes in space as well as entering into important cooperative arrangements with scientific institutes. Providers of test and system services and regional clusters and initiatives also play an increasingly important role. 3  A central element in the coming years will be that, in implementing this strategy, German space industry and science actors will, through increased efforts of their own, improve their competitiveness in Europe and the wider world. Germanys 2nd place in Europe should not be merely a reason for satisfaction but should also provide Germany with the impetus to achieve even more. 72. Space: a key to solving global challengesImages"
0,German space strategy Nov10,13,"recorded by TerraSAR-X showing turbulent waters around the island of SyltSpace is a means to an end. Space technology provides infrastructures and services with a view to achieving social, economic and scientific objectives outside of the space sector itself. Germanys space strategy pur-sues this aim and thus forms an integral part of the Federal Governments political objectives. All space projects must therefore be measured according to the contribution they make to achieving those objectives. The Federal Governments strategy aims to use space to address key global challenges and, in so doing, to exploit its economic potential to the utmost: Globalisation One of the principal challenges facing Germany, as  a leading exporter, is globalisation. Flows of data, transport and goods are set to expand still further in the future. The security of worldwide goods traffic is essential in a distributed global economy character-ised by mutual dependencies. The only way to deal with this challenge efficiently is to harness space technology while carrying out the control, distribu-tion and tracking of these global flows. Dependable access to satellite-based services is absolutely essen -tial to the efficient management of land, sea and air traffic.The knowledge society Knowledge, for a country short of raw materials such as Germany, is a strategic resource. Science and re  -search form the basis of technical innovation and are thus also a source of economic added value and social development. It is a decisive advantage to always re  -main one step ahead through innovation and knowl -edge as we seek to defend our"
0,German space strategy Nov10,14,"position in competition with the rest of the world. With missions to explore both space and our home planet, as well as research in space conditions and technology developments on the very edge of what is feasible, space makes a cru-cial contribution to the attainment of knowledge.  Being able to access information at any time from anywhere is one of the core requirements of the know   l-edge society. Doing business effectively is only possi -ble, in the age of globalisation, with secure communi -cations. A globalised media landscape opens the way to transparency within political systems and prevents national isolation. Space-based infrastructures make it possible, by means of satellite communication, to obtain high-quality data anywhere on Earth at any time, and thus prove themselves to be an effective in  -strument for the dissemination and exploitation of knowledge.8 2. Space: a key to solving global challengesWith the help of the European satellite Cryosat-2, launched in 2010, scientists can observe the evolution of polar ice.Climate change, preserving  essential natural resources and global changeThe preservation of natural resources essential to our very existence, together with the measurement, anal -ysis and actions to deal with changes in our planet, including the consequences of climate change, are urgent priorities for all humankind. The monitoring of environmental treaties, weather forecasting, basic scientific research, predicting the consequences of climate change, effective management of natural resources such as land, water and minerals and cop-ing with natural disasters all require innovative Earth observation and communication technologies, which, in many instances,"
0,German space strategy Nov10,15,"only space is able to deliver. It is particularly essential in the case of climate change, due to its global dimension, for a reliable, neutral and comprehensive assessment to be made of its conse-quences as well as a proper evaluation of the measures taken in responding to it. Space applications are parti -cularly  if not uniquely  suited to promptly providing policymakers with the data and monitoring in   stru -ments they need to pursue evidence-based policies.Whole-of-government security  preparednessGermanys security policy environment has under -gone substantial changes in recent years. While pre -vious threats to Germany and its citizens may have receded, Germany must now join forces with its allies and partners to confront a new set of global risks and challenges. This calls for a coordinated, networked security approach that encompasses all means avail-able to the state and also includes the participation of non-governmental actors. Space-based systems play a key role in providing early warnings of impending crises and thereby boosting the Federal Governments assessment capabilities. They enable the targeted deployment of forces even far from Germanys borders and can deliver information vital for the rapid mobili-sation of aid efforts. Military operations, in particular, are now inconceivable without the support of space-based systems. Space systems in the domains of com-munication, navigation and Earth observation make a decisive contribution to Germanys ability to con -duct an effective foreign and security policy and to achieve whole-of-government security preparedness. 9Orientation toward benefits  and needsThe overriding aim must, at all times, be to continue improving"
0,German space strategy Nov10,16,"human living conditions. State-funded space activities must therefore be channelled towards space for the benefit of the Earth.  Space projects will be judged according to the contribution they make to solving the challenges fac -ing global society and whether the long-term applica -tion of high levels of funding can be expected to bring adequate benefits.  These benefits may lie in a variety of areas: in contributing to global environmental management, in providing efficient support to government in the performance of its duties, in space functioning as a tool of science and not least in bringing economic added value. In that last area  and extending way beyond the space industry proper  significant poten-tial lies in applications and services markets which are only made possible through space-based infra-structures.   The Federal Government focuses its space policy strictly on benefits and needs while, at the same time, targeting visionary goals. To that end, space must, in competition with other instruments and with terres-trial processes and infrastructures, demonstrate that it offers the better solution from a cost-benefit stand-point. As tools of research, space projects must be guided by the benchmarking (scientific excellence) principle. In large-scale projects they must show that they can prevail in competition with other methods and scientific disciplines.   The focus on benefits and needs requires early and wide-ranging involvement of, as well as a sharing of responsibility by, users of space systems and services in the concept design, funding and execution of pro-jects. It is immaterial whether those users are"
0,German space strategy Nov10,17,"public entities, scientists, research facilities or companies, especially from the industrial or service sector. Ulti -m ately, the design and execution of a space project must depend not only on its technological appeal and scien  tific excellence, but also, and above all, on the needs of the users and their readiness to assume re  -spon   sibility themselves.3.  Guidelines of the Federal Governments  space policySpace robotics  a driver for the very latest technological developments (First German national conference on space robotics, 13   14 May 2009, Berlin)10Orientation toward the principle of sustainabilityThe government, the economy and society all depend increasingly on properly-functioning space infra -structures. It is highly developed industrial nations such as Germany which particularly require secure communication, navigation and Earth observation if they are to be able to protect their citizens. Yet at the same time, it is important to realise that threats to important space-based infrastructures are on the rise, due to natural causes such as solar storms or meteor-ites, but also from space debris such as decommis -sioned satellites and jettisoned rocket stages or their fragments, and finally from potential targeted inter -ference, notably from Earth.  Germanys contributions to space activities are consistently oriented toward the notion of sustain -ability  that is, they are implemented in a way that will also allow future generations to take full advan-tage of the possibilities of space. Thus, it is essential when it comes to designing future space activities, that these are based on an effective, generally"
0,German space strategy Nov10,18,"accepted regulatory framework at national and international level, that there is an avoidance of producing space debris, and that space systems are afforded proper protection. This principle continues to gain in impor-tance as the trend is increasingly towards miniaturi -sation, the availability of new technologies at reduced cost and, therefore, towards increasing numbers of space users outside state-sponsored space pro-grammes and the big space firms.Intensifying international  cooperation Due to their technical complexity and high cost, many space projects can be realised only through international cooperation. The Federal Government therefore intends to further expand international cooperation through coordination with its partners as a means of avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort and overcapacity while also improving space sector efficiency. To that end, the priority remains, in particular for the creation of large strategic infra-structures, European cooperation through ESA and EUMETSAT as well as bilateral and multilateral coop -erative efforts. In the field of Earth observation, 3.  Guidelines of the Federal Governments space policyThe German Earth observation satellite TerraSAR-X provided data on movements of the Earths crust after the Haiti earthquake at the beginning of 2010: green indicates minimal movement, red is for shifts of two metres.forums for international coordination such as the Group on Earth Observation, the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites and the International Charter Space and Major Disasters are increasingly important. In areas such as space research, exploration and human spaceflight, projects will also be carried out in well-established long-term partnerships with non-European partners. In this regard, it must be ensured that German and"
0,German space strategy Nov10,19,"joint European contributions to such cooperative efforts form a substantial and essen-tial part of the missions in question. To achieve this, it is vital to be in a position of strength in the key tech -nology areas.  At the same time, we aim  as in all other industrial export markets  to enhance our competitiveness in the increasingly crowded commercial space markets. In each individual case, the correct balance between cooperation and competition will have to be struck. Thus we will be guided by the following principle: strategic space activities affect German national interests (including commercial interests) and there-fore require Germany to maintain its own compe -tences and expertise; large-scale scientific or opera -tional space missions are to be carried out through international cooperation. 114.  Fields of action: making Germanys space  sector fit for the future A S-GEO-type satellite in Earth orbit (artists impression)Our country is bound to a long tradition of outstand -ing scientists and pioneers. The Federal Government will therefore make greater use of the growing oppor -tunities offered by space, with the primary focus on the following areas:a) Expanding strategic space expertiseTo ensure comprehensive exploitation of space, Germany must maintain its own system competences, enjoy guaranteed access to strategic key technolo-gies, and have the capability to operate such systems and control the associated value chain. This requires the existence of a scientific, technical and industrial base within Germany, not least in the interests of autonomy of action. Long-term, such domestic com-petences serve to maintain competitiveness and the scope for"
0,German space strategy Nov10,20,"sovereign political action and strengthen Germanys competitiveness relative to its partners in Europe and across the world.  Through a combination of its National Space Programme and selective involvement in ESAs tech -nology and applications programmes, Germany aims to develop capabilities and key technologies in appli -cation domains that are both promising commercial -ly and relevant strategically. High-calibre, globally competitive firms and scientific excellence are indis -pensable to ensure Germanys interests are best served when it embarks on international cooperation, within ESA, for example, but also as it faces increased competition within Europes internal market.  In this context, attaining, expanding and main -taining system capabilities and technological superi -ority in selected key, pace-setting technologies are of fundamental importance. Missions that manage to achieve the broadest possible application of these technologies are particularly suited to promoting German core competences in space and serve to enhance Germanys profile.  In the fields of Earth observation, space science, and recently in satellite communications, Germany has demonstrated its ability to acquire systems com-petence and take the technological lead. Germany has assumed the lead role in the development of a small communication satellite within ESA (S-GEO) and, as a result, will in future be able to act indepen-dently in this commercially attractive and strategical -ly important field. In addition, system capability in the ground segment, in international standards for transmission technology and in the corresponding terminal technologies, form the basis for added value downstream.12 By aiming for cutting-edge performance in high-tech domains, Germany also aims to develop national competences in"
0,German space strategy Nov10,21,"areas offering great future potential. We will also establish clear priorities in service areas outside the space industry proper such as the analysis and distribution of Earth observation data. Though the space sector creates infrastructures, most of the added value occurs in product and service domains outside the classical space domains that make use of those infrastructures. Only when the economic poten-tial of these domains is successfully unlocked can the high, mostly governmental, investments in infra -structure be justified. Federal Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy at the event marking the start of the Franco-German satellite project MERLIN, February 2010Objectives:3  Germany will further expand its already first-rate capabilities in Earth observation, in particular in the radar domain (and above all in X-Band, suited to high geometric resolution) as well as acquiring control over the complete system chain. Germany will also support future technologies in Earth ob  -servation such as hyper spectral remote sensing, in which complex satellite-based sensor systems capture wavelengths ranging from short-wave ultraviolet to long-wave infrared. Using hyper spectral remote sensing, it is possible, for exam-ple in the agricultural domain, to assess crop yields and analyse damage to forests, but also to conduct mineralogical exploration and environ-mental monitoring. At the Franco-German Minis -terial Council in Paris in February 2010 the start -ing gun was fired on the Franco-German climate mission MERLIN (Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission) whose aim is to monitor the formation and spread of the greenhouse gas methane world - wide and thus to support international action to protect the climate."
0,German space strategy Nov10,22,"In this Franco-German part -nership, Germany has taken on the task of devel -oping the complex instrument. In Earth observa -tion, new markets are also clearly emerging for space technology, high-value data products and downstream services with the result that Earth observation is not only becoming a driver for geo-information but is also an economic factor in its own right. In Earth observation especially, effi -cient exploitation is dependent to a high degree on having a state-of-the-art ground segment. In addition to the technologies and infrastructures used to control satellites, and to receive and pro-cess data, a central role is played by cutting-edge technologies for long-term archival, evaluating data or combining and linking data from differ-ent sensors. Efficient exploitation, though it depends both on ongoing basic research and on applications-focused developments, is also underpinned by a continuous process of foster-ing young talent through first-rate university education. 3  In satellite communication, Germany will extend its systems capability with regard to the building of geostationary communication satellites and will drive forward strategic satellite technologies such as laser communication. In this way, Ger -many will acquire a strong competitive position in this commercially and strategically important space sector, while at the same time making an important contribution towards ensuring the efficiency of Europes communication infrastruc-ture for security-related applications, Earth observation, space research, and exploration.3  In satellite navigation, Germany will maintain its lead role in Europes Galileo navigation system and develop the necessary innovative navigation applications and procedures aimed at ensuring that the highest security requirements can be"

The Federal Governments long-term aim is to ensure that Galileo exploita-tion is a commercial success and, in particular,  to facilitate access to international markets for inno   vative smaller firms. To that end, the Federal Government is making national funding availa -ble, through the BMWi (Federal Ministry of Eco -nomics and Technology), for several test beds for the Galileo Test and Development Environment (GATE), providing an early incentive to develop and test innovative Galileo products and applica-tions in Germany. 3  We will place particular emphasis on the further technological development of robot capabilities, mechatronics, artificial intelligence and autono-mous systems, which, in their ability to act as cross-cutting future technologies, are clearly especially suited to meeting space-specific chal-lenges while also delivering benefits back on Earth and developing future global markets. In this respect, Germany already has excellent founda-tions in place, as seen in the new focus on robot -ics research within the National Space Pro  g ramme and the expansion of the DLR Institute of Robot -ics and Mechatronics. The task now is to pool and further develop our national capabilities in a selective manner so as to allow Germany to take further strides within the leading group of space faring nations. In this connection,"
0,German space strategy Nov10,24,"the central challenge in the coming years will be to establish synergies between space robotics and terrestri-al robotics, as well as between various research institutes and various firms. On-orbit satellite ser -vicing will open up a new dimension for the com -mercial space sector, too: in future, robots will be responsible for the refuelling, servicing, repair, and controlled disposal of satellites in orbit, en abling operators to manage entire satellite fleets. In this way, it will be possible also to address the growing problem of space debris and im  -prove the sustainability of space activities.3  Particular attention must be paid to establishing a competitive industry in downstream growth markets. Whether German industry positions itself successfully in the large markets for services and terminals will depend largely on the initia-tive it shows and on its independent strategic positioning. There are a great many new oppor-tunities in this area, particularly for SMEs with their high potential for innovation. The DEOS project is intended to capture satellites that stray from their orbital path.b) Establishing a unified legal frameworkFor private investment in the space sector and the development of private enterprise business models to occur, there is a need for a dependable legal frame-work and reliable planning data. Germany, with its rules on satellite data security, has already taken the lead in Europe, as recognised by the international community. This has enabled the Federal Govern -ment to press ahead with the task of developing com -mercial markets in the Earth observation sector and also to ensure the protection"
0,German space strategy Nov10,25,"of its foreign and securi -ty policy interests. The Federal Government is cur -rently working on a German Space Act aimed at pro -viding a clear and comprehensive legal framework for non-governmental, especially commercial and private space activities. This is in response to Ger -manys obligations under international law with regard to the approval and monitoring of such activi-ties. Together with a long-term strategy and future-oriented space programme, the law will provide a clear framework in which science and industry will be able to operate in Germany.14The number of satellites orbiting the Earth is constantly rising (artists impression, objects not to scale in relation to the Earth). The need in specific cases to protect strategic high technologies in an increasingly globalised in   dustrial landscape presents a particular challenge. In the case of the technologies in listed military or dual-use prod -ucts, transfer is already fully regulated and is subject to national and European export control provisions; the export of critical space technology to non-EU, non- NATO or similarly categorised states is subject to strict conditions.  There is a growing need for a national and inter -national legal framework in the space sector. This already exists in areas such as frequency allocation and the definition of orbital positions for satellites. What is urgently needed today are regulations on preventing and disposing of space debris, liability in the event of collisions in space and other accidents and the protection of space-based infrastructures from attack. The EU has touched on this theme with its slogan Security"

Order and security in space can only be achieved through international cooperation.  The Federal Government has for many years been active in pressing for the establishment of interna -tional standards to prevent the generation of further space debris. The guidelines drawn up within the framework of the UN Committee on The Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) are an important first step. The DLR, for its part, is actively involved in the European Network of Competences on Space Debris. German scientists, meanwhile, are taking the lead in developing procedures to measure and model space debris. In addition, work is ongoing into ways of extending satellite lifetimes and recovering objects from space. Preventing an arms race in outer space remains an important objective for Germany. We make clear our views on this in the relevant forums for interna-tional cooperation  following close coordination with our (EU) partners. The Federal Government is in favour of a resumption of the substantive work of the Geneva Disarmament Conference and would wel-come discussions and negotiations within the Pre -ven tion of an Arms Race in Outer Space working group.

These extend from the examination of scientific principles and theories to the discovery of completely new phenomena. As well as pure acquisi-tion of knowledge, basic research also provides an important boost to innovation on Earth. In the extreme environmental conditions that prevail in space, science missions frequently operate at the very limits of tech-nical feasibility. As such, they frequently act as drivers for technological excellence. It is"
0,German space strategy Nov10,28,"important also to remember that our top scientists have another res -ponsibility: to the education and training of the next generation of scientists.  Germany has a strong position in space research  i. e. in space exploration (astronomy, Sun, planets, comets) as well as research under space conditions (physics, materials science, biology, medicine). We aim to consistently and sustainably expand this posi-tion. In addition to ESAs science programmes, the National Space Programme also has an important role to play in achieving this goal, notably through bilateral cooperation with other countries and fund-ing national contributions to ESA missions.  A proper balance must also be struck between scientific and applications-related space activities. Together, they power the further development of industrial and research structures and competence in key pace-setting technologies.  As well as placing a high value on basic research, we aim first and foremost to prioritise, wherever pos -sible, the transfer of scientific results to economic 16uses and applications, while also focusing on sustain -ability and the protection of our environment and technical systems (notably from external influences on the climate, space weather, near-Earth asteroids).

Examples include infrared and X-ray astron -omy, research into gravitational waves, funda -mental processes in plasma and colloidal physics, Bose-Einstein condensates and space weather. A new large-scale project that will take place in the near future is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), designed to search for antimatter and dark matter in space from an external platform on the ISS.

Space activities, as an enabling technology, also have a significant economic impact. They provide infrastruc-tures that enable new value chains to be created in other economic sectors, especially in downstream value-added services."

This is the case, for example, in the markets for satellite TV reception (with dishes, receivers, etc.). The overall economic activity generated by space infrastructure is greater roughly by a factor of 10  and even many times that in some cases.  As it becomes increasingly applications-oriented, space is providing a basis for commercial activity in  a number of fields. Satellite communication, naviga -tion and, to a large extent, Earth observation are just a few examples of the increasing practical benefits to 4.

As these markets grow, the government  after pro-viding the initial spark through substantial invest-ments  can focus increasingly on its role of setting the appropriate policy framework and promoting new types of future technologies. German Earth observation satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X provide data used to generate a 3-dimensional digital elevation model of unique quality. These data are also used for commercial purposes. The objective is to develop in a systematic man -ner the competences that give rise to business models for services. By focusing on private enterprise and commercialisation, Earth observation activities in particular will be given a sustained boost, while es  -tablished technologies will be supported from out -side R&D budgets.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) and new models for funding and operating space-based infrastructures must be pro-moted. From an industry perspective, PPP models are a strategic measure particularly suited to the develop -ment of new markets.   Space is a dynamically developing sector, presen  t-ing both challenges and opportunities to German in  -dustry. The growing international markets in countries with no space industry of their own, in particular, offer considerable opportunities to German firms. In addi-tion, the commercial and institutional markets in the emerging economies of Africa and South-East Asia will gain in importance in the future. The economic potential of these emerging markets is already improving in many sectors with the help of satellite communications. At the same time, public authorities in almost every country in the world also use space applications and the associated services to varying degrees.  German industry must display creativity and entrepreneurial spirit if it is to establish a presence in world markets, both with space products themselves and with downstream services. Further, in view of the increasing competition from the emerging econo-mies in the markets for space infrastructure and launch services, German industry must concentrate more than ever on achieving cutting-edge performance in high-tech areas. Currently, it is new and continuing development activities directly or indirectly connect-ed to payloads, applications and data that form the basis for the future commercial success of Germanys space industry. The development of additional mar-kets will depend on whether major technological advances in"

Just as with sat -ellite communication, entirely new markets will be created in satellite-based Earth observation and navigation  as well as through their links with integrated applications. This in turn creates the necessary conditions for the build-up of know-how and intellectual property. German firms are therefore ready to take up the challenge of using creative and innovative ideas to meet domestic governmental demand and to develop new markets. Industry must make full use of this opportunity to increase its share of global space sector activities by ensuring that it remains at the cutting-edge in high-tech areas.e) Exploiting space for civil and military security purposesSpace-based systems for Earth observation, communi -cation, navigation and the observation of the Sun and near-Earth asteroids are central to many areas of national security. Satellite data and services make a vital contribution, notably to disaster relief and man-agement, environmental and climate"
0,German space strategy Nov10,33,"protection, to warning of threats, development aid, border monitor -ing and arms control.  Many civil applications have become quite incon -ceivable without the assistance of meteorological and other satellites. Reliable and safe transport by air, land and sea is no longer possible without satellite-based weather forecasting. Environmental, energy, town and regional planning can be precisely and effi-ciently supported by means of satellite mapping. For climate research and monitoring the global view pro -vided by satellite systems is absolutely indispensable.  In particular, Germanys highly developed capa -bilities in radar remote sensing and the associated assessment methods make it uniquely positioned to provide support in dealing with natural disasters and other crises. We will ensure that Germany is able to count on a national civil system for the reliable provi-sion of such services. At the same time, these opera -tional capacities will make a valuable contribution to European needs in this area. In the military domain, too, satellite-based sys -tems have become completely indispensable. Strategic reconnaissance and long-distance com -mand and control capabilities are now among the essential requirements for modern, efficiently-run armed forces. An essential element in this develop-ment is the increased use of space-based systems for independent national communication and recon -naissance capabilities. These capabilities are vitally important if Germany is to continue to contribute to international peacekeeping missions and play its proper role in global politics. Space competences form a crucial part of operational capability.   Our nations internal and external stability de  -pends increasingly on the proper functioning of our"

Fields of action: making Germanys space sector fit for the future 19even to targeted attacks aimed specifically at impor -tant space-based capabilities. In future, our efforts to guarantee our security must also extend to the pro -tection of these infrastructures and to a situational assessment capability. For any such infrastructure to function satisfactorily, it must also be provided with secure communications for its control and use. To ensure compliance with the specific IT security re  -quirements applying to space activities, we will en  -courage the establishment and continued updating of the corresponding procedures.  The availability of key technologies and national systems competence in the military space domain is of fundamental importance to the Federal Ministry of Defence. The Satcom BW und SAR Lupe satellite systems constituted important milestones in that regard. Whereas in the United States and many other coun-tries, it is the military that is far and away the main driver of new and innovative developments in tech -nology, in Germany, innovations in the space sector tend to stem mostly from technologies developed for civil and scientific applications. We shall therefore, wherever possible, exploit synergies between civil developments and dual-use technologies when fur-ther developing system capabilities and strategically important competences in key technologies both in Germany and Europe. All government departments involved in space activities are called upon to engage in the continuous coordination of their technology and industrial policies aimed"
0,German space strategy Nov10,35,"at promoting Germany as a centre for space and innovation and to review their policies in terms of their implications for whole-of-government security preparedness. Tasks in core areas of state activity are fundamen -tally different from the standard tasks of a research establishment or research administration. We will review the current administrative structures within the German space sector to determine whether they meet these specific requirements and adapt them as necessary.  The German armys five-satellite military Earth observation system SAR-Lupe (artists impression)Objectives: 3  Germany will make greater use of the potential for synergy between civil and military space research in the development of security-related technologies in the Earth observation and tele-communications sectors, for example. 203  Within the limits imposed by the national budget, we will secure for the long term and gradually build up the space infrastructure Europe requires for environmental, climate, transport and securi-ty purposes. In particular, we will also increase the use of this infrastructure for government pur -poses, thereby contributing to the modernisation of government. 3  Space-based systems perform an increasingly important function with respect to civil and mili -tary security in Germany and Europe. Closer coor -dination between the various arms of govern -ment as well as over government activities will prevent duplication and ensure a better use of resources. 3  It is of vital importance to Germanys security that we ensure the proper functioning of space systems in the face of natural and human threats while also allowing access to the exploitation of space. These objectives"
0,German space strategy Nov10,36,"are of particular impor-tance in respect of all government activities relat -ing to space. With that end in mind, an essential contribution will be made by building up a national competence for space situational aware-ness through the use of existing resources. The European Space Agency (ESA) controls most of its missions from control rooms at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt.f) Shaping the distribution of roles in the European space sectorWith the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU has now acquired competence in respect of space activities. Member states of both ESA and the EU have been preparing themselves for this new situation for years and, through the ESA/EU Framework Agree -ment of 2004 and the resolutions passed in 2007 by the Space Council (joint meeting of the ESA and EU Councils), have already established the basis for implementing new EU space activities.  In the field of space policy, the guiding criterion for the distribution of work among institutions must remain the preservation of the overall performance and capabilities of the European space sector. Du   pli-cate structures must be avoided and expenditure on coordination and administration kept within limits. Accordingly, tried-and-tested structures which have helped make the European space sector a widely acknowledged and technologically cutting-edge player on the world stage must be maintained and, wherever possible, strengthened.  In the framework of ESA, which coordinates European space activities, European countries have been working together with great success for 35 years. ESA member states are still responsible for"
0,German space strategy Nov10,37,"funding well over 90  % of institutional space activities in Europe. Inside Europe, ESA is firmly established as the focus for European cooperation in the space sec-tor. It has wide-ranging experience and the right tools to conduct complex, demanding space projects. Its funding system ensures a fair division of costs and benefits within European space projects. In addition, ESA has, through its actions, proved itself to be a thor-oughly trustworthy partner in international coopera -tion. For all these reasons, an independent, strong ESA continues to be essential to the success of the European space sector. The Federal Government therefore remains committed to strengthening ESA as an intergovernmental institution. It is against this background that the EU will de  -velop its space activities. With regard to space appli -cations and exploitation, it should focus on such acti -vities as complement or supplement already existing activities carried out by ESA, member states and spe-cialist user organisations such as EUMETSAT (Euro -pean Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorolo -gical Satellites). Due also to limited budgets, the two key projects, Galileo and GMES, will remain the prime 4.  Fields of action: making Germanys space sector fit for the future 21focus for some time to come.

0,German space strategy Nov10,38,"substantial effort, the potential for applications, in particular, must also be borne in mind. This factor is expected to strengthen Europes competitiveness and enhance its capacity for innova-tion. Successful implementation of these two key EU projects will be the test of the EUs ability to set up and operate space infrastructures in a cost efficient manner. Looking ahead to the long term, the EU must, if it is to be able to take on new space activities, first acquire the necessary tools to do so. We shall continue to in  -sist that  as frequently called for in the Space Coun  cil   adequate instruments, funding schemes and procure -ment procedures, must be introduced within the EU to meet the specific requirements of the institutional-ly dominated space market.  Like member states, the EU will also be able to use ESA in the future as a service provider for the imple -mentation of its space activities, task it with carrying out space programmes and take part in ESA optional programmes. In addition to ESA and the EU, the member states themselves  with their national programmes and bilateral/multilateral cooperative projects  form the third pillar of European space activities, particularly on defence projects. This latter pillar is the principal framework for cooperation in the view of the Federal Government. Objectives:3  Germany, with the largest economy in the EU and as its biggest contributor, will have a crucial say in determining the role of the EU based on the provisions of the Lisbon"
0,German space strategy Nov10,39,"Treaty. Given the back-ground of budget restrictions, the Federal Government will also call, above all, for a clear demarcation of roles based on the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity, avoiding duplicate activities and structures, and establish-ing the necessary funding and contract proce -dures to meet the specific requirements of the space sector. The completion and ongoing opera-tion of Galileo and GMES will have top priority. 3  Germany will continue to press for a strengthen -ing of ESA as an independent intergovernmental organisation. ESA alone has the many years expe-rience of management and coordination, as well as the set of tried-and-tested instruments required to conduct complex, highly demanding space projects. In the view of the Federal Government, therefore, even after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, ESA remains the most suitable framework within which to implement the Euro -pean space policy and to conduct Europe-wide cooperation in space matters. 3  Moreover, after 35 years of successful operations, ESA remains a vibrant, still growing organisation. Its continual evolution, as seen notably with regard to voting rights, financial reform, and pro-grammatic priorities, remains  not least because of its willingness to accept additional member states  an important task in which Germany is actively and constructively engaged. 3  For Germany, this participation in European space activities also means that it must be ade -quately represented by qualified German staff at all levels across the European institutions, but particularly in the senior leadership positions. The Federal Government will continue to support measures to optimise the"
0,German space strategy Nov10,40,"proportion of German representatives within all European bodies. We call upon industry, when filling management positions in European firms, to ensure that all participating nations are equitably represented.g) Defining the roles of Germany and Europe in explorationMissions to explore space in situ always exert a par -ticular fascination. They give rise to the hope that, by venturing into space, humankind will be able to pro -vide new answers regarding the origin of life as well as the where from and where to  i.e. the starting point and destination  of human existence. This 22applies equally to manned missions to low-Earth orbits (for example, to the International Space Station) as well as to robotic missions to explore the depths of the cosmos. Inside Europes International Space Station laboratory module Human spaceflight efforts will continue to be directed towards the International Space Station for at least another ten years. Thus the ISS  with its con-sistent and well-established division of labour among partners  will remain the centrepiece of scientific research under space conditions. As a result, a key pri-ority here must be to obtain the best possible return on European investment within the existing struc-tures and commitments. A decision on possible fol-low-up activities, based on a full cost-benefit analysis of ISS operations, will have to be taken in a few years time.  Exploration projects too must be measured according to the extent to which they contribute to solving the challenges facing our society. Exploration missions must therefore serve a clear scientific pur-pose, such as basic"
0,German space strategy Nov10,41,"research into the origin of the Solar System, for example. They must be of high tech -nical quality and their results must be subject to transparent verification. We will therefore continue to insist that Europes commitment to exploration must concentrate on projects of high scientific value with great potential for technological applications, including in non-space domains. ESA, with its many years of experience with the planning, funding and execution of long-term European space projects must therefore continue to play the central role in this regard in the future. Europe must bring to the table its specific strengths and experience, most notably in the area of robotics, sharing out work in cooperative endeavours with other spacefaring nations. Intelligent, autonomous robotic systems are key technologies when it comes to the further explora -tion of space. Extending mankinds reach into space, intelligent robots will permanently change the face of future space activities: robotic systems will land on planets, moons and asteroids and explore them, bringing major advances in our exploration of the Solar System. Initially, the Moon, as the subject of sci-entific exploration closest to Earth, is ideally placed to begin the testing and demonstration of robotic tech -4.  Handlungsfelder  die deutsche Raumfahrt fr die Zukunft strken23nologies. Technologies tested and further developed there at reasonable cost can then be used on explora -tion missions to more remote destinations involving a global coordination and cooperative effort. The cru -cial factors in the success of robotic systems are a high degree of mobility, precise manipulation, and the ability to"
0,German space strategy Nov10,42,"operate autonomously in far-away locations.  Space robotics provides very direct benefits to society. Developing robotic space technologies requires the highest level of engineering and science prowess in a multidisciplinary environment that ranges from artificial intelligence, autonomous sys-tems, virtual reality, miniaturisation, materials engi -neering and mechatronics to information and com -munication technology. It also opens up the widest range of terrestrial applications. Robotic capabilities are key elements in future space technologies and act as springboard technologies for applications on Earth. Robotics is also a highly innovative branch of industry that offers substantial market opportunities to SMEs. With our space robotics strategy, we are already investing in technologies with great future potential of considerable importance to the development of Germanys economy and society. This strategy also sends out a clear signal that Germany intends to be a strong presence in European and international robot-ic exploration of the Solar System. Robotic systems made in Germany are set to become a significant new brand presence on the international market. Objectives:3  The International Space Station is a symbol of peaceful international cooperation in orbit and should be exploited intensively since it is a unique laboratory allowing research of the high-est level to be conducted. A comprehensive assessment of ISS operations will be made that will provide us with the basis for a decision on a possible follow-up system or on other options. 3  For Germany, developing autonomous systems, especially in the field of robotic exploration of the Solar System, is a matter of the highest priority. We will"

DLR study for a Martian roverh) Securing technological inde-pendence and access to spaceAccess to key technologies and high-performance launchers are essential preconditions to civil and mil -itary space activities. However, in that, both are no more than the means to an end. Germanys aim is to ensure access to technologies and space transporta-tion systems for the lowest possible cost so as to remain internationally competitive and obtain the maximum benefit from investments in space applica-tions.  Within the framework of ESA, European access to space is guaranteed by Ariane 5, to which Frances contribution is some 60  %. Through its contributions within the ESA framework, Germany currently has a 30 % share in Ariane 5 and as such is the second big -gest partner in the Ariane programme. Germany is responsible for developing and building the launch -ers crucial upper stage, delivers essential compo -nents such as the boosters, tanks and parts of the pro -pulsion system and has expertise in propulsion tech -nology based on storable propellant. With its mix of commercial and institutional launches, Ariane 5 is currently the best means of guaranteeing European access to space. However, if this situation is to continue, Ariane must remain com-mercially successful in the launcher market.  24The European Ariane 5 launcher lifts off from Kourou spaceport, French Guiana The Federal Government will therefore continue to support technological measures aimed at improv -ing Arianes competitiveness in the launcher market.   As a result of the shift"
0,German space strategy Nov10,44,"in emphasis in US space policy, which, after the Space Shuttle is retired from service, will rely on commercial launch service pro -viders for transport to the ISS, substantial changes and further overcapacity in the global launcher mar -ket may well occur. Were that to be the case, it could be necessary to conduct a thorough, root and branch review of European launcher policy. Our aim is to ensure that Europe has access to space transpor-tation systems that is as cost-effective as possible. To this end, possibilities for international cooperation and an international division of labour should also be considered. The western world must retain a human space -flight capability for as long as robotic systems remain incapable of fully replacing the human presence for conducting space activities. We will continue to dis-cuss this with our partners in Europe, the United States and Japan.  The Federal Government will continue to sup -port efforts aimed at guaranteeing unhindered access to key technologies. It is essential for critical components and hardware to be readily available in Europe. At present, certain hardware items can only be ob   tained in the US and are subject to ITAR export restrictions.

Germany is extensively involved in the research and devel -opment of space transportation systems and in shaping European launcher policy. Its main focus is on system competence for the Ariane 5 launcher upper stage. Germany aims to ensure the most cost-effective possible access to space transportation systems, to maintain the interna-tional competitiveness of Ariane 5 and, in so doing, to ensure a high level of national added value.3  It is essential for critical components and hard -ware to be readily available in Europe. Germany therefore supports intensified efforts to develop critical hardware and components in Europe in order to avoid dependency on any single source. A successful conclusion to an Ariane launch: payload separation, in this case for Herschel and Planck (artists impression)265. SummaryLunar Lander, a study for an unmanned moon lander (artists impression)Germanys space sector can point to some remarkable successes in recent years. There are a number of rea -sons for this: the countrys research and development performance, the increase in the national space budget and the maintenance of our ESA budget con-tributions at a high level. Through targeted support for the further advancement of national technologi -cal capabilities (some of which are unique world -wide), Germany has succeeded in gaining a leading position  often within the framework of ESA and other forms of international cooperation  in key fields such as Earth observation and the new field of laser communications. The German space sector currently confronts a "
0,German space strategy Nov10,46,"new set of challenges.3  Space technologies will be the site of increasing competition at the national, European and inter -national level.3  Private enterprise business models  are gaining in importance: the new US Space Policy unveiled in June 2010, for example, laid special emphasis on the need to develop and expand commercial markets through and for space technologies.3  New players are taking the stage: in Europe, the Lisbon Treaty has given the EU its own compe -tences in the field of space policy. This raises questions as to the future division of roles between ESA, with its tried-and-tested processes, the EU and the National Space Programme.3  The United States, the most significant player among all spacefaring nations, has effected a fundamental reorientation of its space policy: with the halting of the Constellation programme, robotic research, Earth observation, utilisation of the International Space Station (ISS) and technol-ogy development are now to the fore, replacing the earlier priorities of manned missions to the Moon or Mars.  3  In addition, the increased activities of countries such as China, India and South Korea  are strengthening the competition within global space markets.The central focus of the Federal Governments space policy is on space applications and concrete benefits for humanity. Space activities must be in competi-tion with other technology domains and be judged 27according to whether their high cost is adequately compensated for by the scientific, social or commer -cial benefits they bring. To summarise, a clear orientation towards bene -fits and needs , the"
0,German space strategy Nov10,47,"principle of sustainability, and intensive international cooperation  particularly within Europe  are the guiding principles of our policy in the following areas:1) Expanding strategic space expertiseWe aim to strengthen systems capability and technol -ogy leadership in selected key or pace-setting tech -nologies.3  We will further expand Germanys first-rate Earth observation capabilities, particularly in the radar domain (and especially X-band, suitable for high geometric resolution) with the aim of acquiring expertise along the entire system chain. Germany is also prioritising the development of future technologies such as hyper spectral Earth obser-vation and lidar measurements of atmospheric composition. In this field it is particularly clear that, in addition to basic Earth system research and monitoring tasks for the public sector, com-mercial markets are also beginning to emerge. Thus, Earth observation is not only a driver for geoinformation but is very much an economic factor in its own right. 3  In satellite communication, another important sector commercially, we will extend our systems capability with regard to geostationary commu-nication satellites while pressing ahead with stra -tegic satellite technologies such as laser commu -nication and electronically controlled antennas.  3  In satellite navigation, we will develop innovative navigation applications and procedures for satis -fying the strictest security requirements.3  We will place special emphasis on the ongoing technological development of robot capabilities, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, which, in their ability to act as cross-cutting, future technologies, are clearly especially suited to combining space-specific challenges with ter-restrial benefits and the development of future global markets. 3 "
0,German space strategy Nov10,48,"Particular attention must be paid to establishing a competitive industry in downstream growth markets. Gaining a successful position in the vast markets for services and terminal equipment will largely be up to the initiative of companies them-selves and the way they position themselves stra -tegically. There are a great many new opportuni -ties in this sector, particularly for SMEs, given their great potential for innovation.2) Sustainably reinforcing our strong position in space researchThe dense ash cloud from Icelands Eyjafjallajkull volcano as seen by the European Earth observation satellite, Envisat in April 20103  We aim to expand Germanys strong position, in European and international terms, in the explo -ration of the Solar System and cosmos and in the scientific exploitation of space for physics, mate -rials sciences, biology and medicine (research under space conditions). As one of the leading nations in space research, we will bring German expertise and excellence to bear more strongly within the framework of ESA missions as well as 28 5. Summarynational and bilateral missions. By efficiently implementing the National Space Programme, we will continue to strengthen German competi-tiveness in science, and thereby play a greater role in shaping ESA programmes.3) Tapping new markets and estab -lishing a unified legal frameworkSatellite-based services are a rapidly developing, dynamic field of business. Alongside satellite commu-nications, Earth observation and navigation are giv -ing rise to a whole new range of market opportuni -ties. German industry faces the challenge of using creative and innovative ideas not just to meet public sector demand at home but also"
0,German space strategy Nov10,49,"to move beyond that and develop new markets. 3  We will draft a German Space Act which, togeth -er with the Satellite Data Security Act (SatDSIG) already in force, will provide a comprehensive legal framework for commercial and private sec -tor space activities.3  We will also seek to persuade the EU and our European partners to introduce analogous rules at EU level and in other spacefaring EU partner countries in order to ensure a level competitive playing field. 3  We aim systematically to extend competences that give rise to business models for services, while also bringing about a durable increase in private-enterprise orientation and commerciali-sation. Demand of governmental origin, too, will be met, where appropriate, through commercial/private enterprise business models (such as PPPs).3  We aim to bring about a substantial increase in German industrys share of global commercial space turnover.

In the mili -tary domain, satellite-based systems have become indispensable. Yet, many civil applications too are now quite inconceivable without data captured by meteorological and other satellites.

We will also step up the use of this infrastructure for government pur -poses, thereby contributing to the modernisation of our administrative structures.3  To protect space systems and applications, we will conduct our own national space situation assessment and exchange and compare this information with key international partners. 5) Shaping the distribution of roles in the European space sectorWith the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty the EU has acquired a parallel competence in respect of space policy, which leaves unaffected the existing competences of member states (and of ESA as an intergovernmental organisation). European coun-tries have collaborated in joint space projects for 35 years, with great success, within the framework pro-vided by ESA. ESA member states are responsible for funding well over 90  % of institutional space activities in Europe. 3  Consequently, we will call for a clear demarca -tion"
0,German space strategy Nov10,51,"of the tasks of the EU in accordance with the principles of complementarity and subsidiarity, avoidance of duplicate activities and structures, but also for the introduction of the necessary funding and procurement procedures to meet the specific requirements of the space sector and reflect the fact that budgets are limited. The highest priority will be given to the completion and continuing operation of Galileo and GMES. 3  We wish to strengthen ESA as an independent intergovernmental organisation with long years of experience and the tried-and-tested instru-ments required to carry out complex and demanding space projects. We are of the view that, even after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, ESA remains the primary framework for European space policy and European space coop-eration. 6) Defining German and European roles in exploration The reorientation of US space policy has made it clear that International Space Station utilisation is set to continue until at least 2020 and will, for the foresee -able future, remain the only relevant objective in the human spaceflight field.3  Against this background, we will, while main -taining the existing distribution of tasks and costs, use the ISS intensively as a unique laborato -ry for first-rate research so as to obtain the great -est possible return on European investment. A comprehensive assessment of ISS operations will be conducted that will provide us with the basis for a decision on a possible follow-up system or on other options.3  For Germany, the development of autonomous robotic systems is a top priority, not least"
0,German space strategy Nov10,52,"as key technologies for space exploration. We shall con-tinue to extend Germanys established compe -tences in this technology of the future. This will include robotic technologies for the safe and sus-tained management of satellite systems in orbit (servicing, disposal) but also for robotic explora-tion of the Solar System. 7) Securing technological  indepen  dence3  Unhindered access to space constitutes an essen -tial element of Europes political sovereignty. We are deeply involved in the research and develop-ment of space transportation systems and play a part in shaping Europes launcher policy. Our principal focus is on system competence for the Ariane launcher upper stage.

Yet I still vividly recall my family and I not only being transfixed by NASAs grainy black and white footage, butalso excited by what the scenes we were witnessing meant for us all.The possibilities that now lay ahead, the ambitions that would be let slip, the breakthroughs we could look forward to. Andof course being five years old it made me want to be an astronaut myself. Such is the unique power of space, turbocharging both our technology and our imaginations.Yet for all the UKs prowess behind the scenes  Armstrongs journey would never have happened without the engineering know-how of a chap from Anglesey named Tecwyn Roberts  we have for too long failed to properly embrace the opportunities that the space industry offers.And so the home of Bell Burnell, Hawking and Payne-Gaposchkin, a country that has done so much to expand and enhance humanitys understanding of the cosmos, hasremained largely earthbound. Whenit comes to getting off the ground we contribute to the work of others rather than taking the lead ourselves.This strategy is about changing that. About tapping our vast pools of talent and enthusiasm, putting the UK firmly in the front rank of the global space industry, and harnessing the technology of space to solve problems and improve public services back down on Earth.Its a plan that will level up the UK by bringing opportunity to every part of it, withsatellites being propelled into orbit from as far afield as Cornwall and Sutherland"

But perhaps fewer of us realise just how essential space is to every aspect of our modern daily life. Every time we use our smartphones to navigate, every time we take a flight, every time we check the weather forecast  we are using space. The Space Race of the 20th century transformed and advanced our technology, our society, and our understanding of our place in the universe. The coming decades will do this again. New technologies and cheaper access to space will let us further explore the Earth and the solar system, deliver new ubiquitous services like space-enabled internet, and make new scientific"

Today the nature of global power is shifting again as we move towards a more intensely competitive world. Space was once only the preserve of superpowers but increased commercial use of space will trigger a new wave of competition. Governments around the world will use a range of methods to compete, and this could include technologies intended to disrupt and deny others use of this domain. Any miscalculation could present a real risk to our wellbeing and security. We must act to prevent this.We will empower British companies to capitalise on new opportunities, with the UK providing a comprehensive end-to-end offer for space businesses to start and grow, including launches into orbit from British spaceports from 2022. Space will help us fight climate change, with satellites providing an extraordinary insight into our climate and environment. And researchers and innovators will use space in new and exciting ways, improving the way we live and work. The UK must be in the vanguard of this next phase of space innovation. The UK can look back on a proud history of activity in space. From our first satellite Ariel1 in 1962 and the launch of the Black Arrow rocket in 1971, to todays construction of the Rosalind Franklin rover which will go to Mars as part of a major international mission, wehave always brought to bear British skills, expertise, and ingenuity.

We will demonstrate leadership internationally, ensuring that space remains safe and sustainable as we enter the next exciting phase of exploration, and we will take steps to ensure that we can protect and defend the UK.National Space Strategy 4The Prime Minister has called for the UK to become a meaningful actor in space, and for the first time this strategy brings together our civil and defence activities into one integrated approach to achieve this ambition. Our partners in the space ecosystem will be vital to delivering this strategy, and we have asked the UK Space Agency and UK Space Command to work together to deliver on these goals. We will work alongside our research sector, expert institutions, agencies and across the whole of government to do this.

Satellites orbiting the Earth only 160 kilometres above our heads keep us connected with our friends, families, and colleagues. They support our present and future security and prosperity, enabling us to navigate the oceans, keep our troops safe, monitor the climate and forecast the weather. And the space sector is a vital part of the UKs economy, worth over 16.4 billion per year and employing over 45,000 people in diverse and exciting roles as scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and innovators.1 Space presents significant opportunities; the global space economy is projected to grow from an estimated 270 billion in 2019 to 490 billion by 2030.2 Constellations of satellites are being launched to deliver worldwide services. New state and commercial space stations are being planned and built. And space tourism operators are flying their first customers into space.

Earth observation satellites increase our understanding of our own planet while telescopes, laboratories, and rovers expand our understanding of the universe. Thetechnologies we develop and knowledge we gain through space support our wellbeing, provide services for our everyday lives, and help us support other countries and meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.53 The UK space economy GVA has grown at 4.7% over the last 4 years, compared with the overall UK GDP growth of 3.7%.4 UK Space Industry: Size and Health Report 2020, published 19 May 2021, available at GOV.UK5 UN Sustainable Development Goals, available at sdgs.un.org/goalsWe use satellites to monitor and map crops to enable more productive agriculture to sustainably feed a growing global population. And countries with capable space systems can lead the way in tackling challenges that face the entire globe, such as the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss.Space is vital to the UKs security and resilience. It is fundamental to the UKs strategic advantage and the successful conduct of military operations. Space capabilities form the backbone of secure global communications, navigation, and intelligence-gathering activities. From the first warning of imminent attacks and tracking of potentially hostile activity, to missile warning systems, space systems underpin the capabilities that keep us safe and competitive.

Human spaceflight and space exploration demonstrate the power and ingenuity of spacefaring nations. Activity in space is essential to the transmission of culture and information and can help provide disaster relief where conventional infrastructure is thin on the ground or destroyed.National Space Strategy 116 New Space refers to the increasing commercialisation of the space sector, moving beyond purely stateactivity.7 BEIS analysis using third party market projections, detailed in the Technical Annex. This implies an annual growth rate of 5.6%.8 Including domestic civil spend from Space Foundation data, ESA contributions, EUMETSAT contributions, and EU space program contributions (Galileo and Copernicus), but excluding space defence spend.The space sector is undergoing a rapid, transformative changeThe cost and complexity of acting in space has fallen dramatically.

UK civil expenditure on space has increased from 300 million in 2014 to 700 million in 2019, and the UK space sector has seen consistently high growth rates.8 However, other nations have invested proportionally more and the UK lags behind our international peers. As a result, whilethe UKsector has continued grow, it is not currently increasing its share of the global space economy. Goonhilly Satellite Array Credit:SpaceportCornwallNational Space Strategy 12But this will not hold the UK back. Thisstrategy sets out how we can become a highly agile space nation and make a generational leap forward in space technologies and capabilities unencumbered by the cost of maintaining older, outdated technologies. The government will act to put the UK space sector in a position to fully capitalise and lead in the new space markets of the future, as well as the established and growing space markets of today. Space is becoming more congested and contestedThe way that space is used is also changing. Constellations of thousands of satellites are being launched to deliver worldwide services. New state and commercial space stations are being planned and built. Space tourism operators are flying their first customers on suborbital spaceflights and robotic servicing spacecraft are extending the lives of older satellites and clearing space debris.

We have a renowned science and technology sector, a strong talent pipeline, and a leading satellite manufacturing and operations capability. We benefit from a highly integrated and mature global supply chain of innovative and established companies and a new launch capability from 2022, as well as growing downstream skills and services in data use and exploitation. We are a growing leader in ancillary services, from a modern regulatory regime to private finance and insurance with the City of London providing an unparalleled global financial services centre. We have many areas of strength, drawing on our holistic offer for the space economy, with the UK being an excellent place to do business. The UK is well placed to leverage those strengths to build leadership in high-growth opportunity areas in the coming years.

Experts rely on space technology in many important areas including security applications and monitoring the climate, environment and ecosystem.As space has become increasingly important in modern life, the international space sector has become highly dynamic and competitive and in recent years has seen an increase in investments The public sector remains the main source of investment. Globally,  US$87 billion in public funding was spent on space activities in 2019.1  Public sector investment in Europe rose four percentage points between 2008 and 2018 (see Figure 1).At the same time, however, new markets have emerged outside of traditional space organisations like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities in Russia, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).1 .

The challenge for Europe is to find out how to respond to the substantial competitive pressure and changes in the space sector and to take a clear and strong position on space policy. Otherwise, Europe risks losing importance (see Figure 6, p.1213). Europe has the chance to position itself as a leader in the space sector with a clear focus on specific disciplines.One of the key approaches here will be to use space activities to address the major environmental, economic and social challenges of the 21st century and ensure a more sustainable future for the benefit of everyone.The goal is for space technologies and their deployment to become key enablers for sustainable development.Space technologies will play an important role in implementing the European Green Deal, reaching the European climate targets such as climate neutrality by 2050, and reaching Austrias target of becoming climate-neutral by 2040.The European Union (EU), ESA and Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD) consider the space sector an increasingly important driver of innovation and economic growth, in particular as part of the digitalisation of the economy.5  Europe IsRepositioning Itself2 .

On the one hand, Austria is building on its diverse space activities in the past and on a well-established community of actors; on the other hand, the new economic dynamics and a focus on sustainability provide Austria with major opportunities to develop its profile in space. Austria has established specific areas of expertise and a leadership role in multiple technologies, both of which are crucial for participating in international value-added chains. Austrias space landscape is characterised by a highly competitive supplier industry with dynamic small and medium-sized companies, a growing number of startups, and established research institutions.  (For more information on the space sector in Austria, see Austria  in Space).10The Austrian Space Applications Programme (ASAP), which was established in 2002, plays an important role in this. The ASAP facilitates collaboration with ESA and the EU and in the commercial space market, making it crucial for Austrias space sector.  Furthermore, the ASAP is the central element for the development of space applications in Austria.Since 2002, the ASAP has funded some 800 projects with a total budget of around EUR 130 million.  Thirty per cent of projects that received funding from the ASAP resulted in an ESA project, nearly twenty percent in an EU research programme, and twenty-five per cent in a contract on the commercial market.Austrias commitment to"

Its participation in ESA programmes, one of the pillars of Austrian space activities, as well as its involvement in the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the EUs space initiatives and programmes are especially relevant for the national space sector.  In the case of EU initiatives and programmes, structural partnerships focused on specific topics are now also planned in addition to bottom-up activities. As the site of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI), Austria is a hub for space diplomacy, policy and law.

Space-based data and services offer significant benefits for sustainable policy-making and innovative solutions in fields such as climate protection and environmental monitoring, land use, renewable energy, mobility, weather and disaster management. In addition, space helps foster the green and digital transformation of our society and economy. For this reason, the Austrian space sector and its framework are influenced by a number of strategic objectives from other areas.  Austrias 20202024 government programme addresses climate neutrality by 2040 and solutions for global challenges through research and innovation. While climate protection is the top priority, sustainability overall is also especially important: ""Environmental protection and a strong economy must not be contradictive.  Our business location can become even more dynamic, we can create more and better jobs, if we invest in sustainability.""11The governments strategy for research, technology, and innovation for 203012 stresses internationalisation, expansion of European and international partnerships, and above all the use of research, technology, and innovation (RTI) to achieve climate targets.  The space sector can play a major role here. The strategy stresses the following climate-related measures in particular:  Developing key technologies to improve climate protection, promoting cooperation and implementation of holistic solutions across sectors (such as the construction and energy sector and mobility), expanding relevant data acquisition activities and the use of digitalisation, and facilitating networking among the relevant actors.
