INTRODUCTION  Semantic segmentation of high -resolution remote sensing image (RSI) can help to extract the land use and land cover (LULC) information [1-5], and has diverse applications, e.g., monitoring [6, 7] , planning [8, 9] , and detection [10, 11] . However, RSI due to the topography with different characteristics, different terrain and different scales are often quite distinct, and the image boundary details of various shapes also make the image segmentation task very challenging.  Conventional methods employ handcrafted features for machine learning [12-15]. Recently deep convolutional neural networks (DC NNs) [16, 17]  have achieved great success in the semantic segmentation of natural scene by learning feature representations and classifier parameters simultaneously. DCNN -based methods obtain high -level features of images but may lose resolution as well and  VOLUME XX, 20 22   2 therefore fail to effectively utilize context information, resulting in rough segmentatio n and discontinuous boundaries. Advanced neural network models such as fully convolutional network (FCN) [18], SegNet [19], U-Net [20] and DeepLab [21] can effectively retain location information while extracting high -level features. The capability of restoring pixel categories makes FCN suitable for i mage semantic segmentation but lacking spatial consistency since relationships between pixels are not fully considered, while SegNet and U -Net are computationally intensive. In DeepLab [21-23], a fully connected conditional random field (CRF) layer"

[24] in an end -to-end way .  Traditional RSI segmentation models are designed for Euclidean dat a and often ignore the inherent correlation between adjacent land covers, while the recently developed graph convolutional networks (GCNs) work directly on structural graphs [25, 26]  and can be naturally applied to model spatial r elations in RSIs, as demonstrated in Mou et al. [27] for hyperspectral image segmentation. If each pixel is treated as a graph node, then the computation of GCN is highly demanded due to the enormous number of pixels in high-resolution RSIs, therefore in [28] superpixels instead of pixels are utilized as the nodes t o greatly reduce the size of the GCN. Though superpixel -based GCN can model various spatial structures of  land cover, it cannot generate subtle individual features for each pixel. In contrast, CNN can learn local ly spectral and spatial features at the pixe l level, but its receptive field is usually limited to a small square window.  Thus, i n this article, a novel dual -stream deep neural network integrating advantages of both GCN and CNN is proposed for semantic segmentation of RSIs, where GCN is utilized to work on graph -level features which have clearer semantic references than image -level features, and CNN with expanded receptive field due to atrous convolution is also included to capture pixel -level multi -scale contextual"

Skip -layers structure is utilized in FCN to achieve the complement of shallow detail information. Many of the state -of-the-art semant ic segmentation methods are based on FCNs. Instead of following the jump connection structure of the typical FCN , the SegN et [19] is an encoder -decoder network  with an innovation in upsampling, which recovers detailed information by drawing on the maximum pooling index in the decoding process, while U -Net [20] utilizes more shal low features to supplement detailed information. Since the aforementioned semantic segmentation models do not make good use of contextual information and thus lead to unsatisfactory segmentation, a novel model named PSPNet with a Pyramid Pooling Module (PP M) is proposed in Zhao et al.  [29] to establish connections between contexts for improved feature representation, but it has the problem of losing pixels when increasing the field of sensation by pooling operations, which may be alleviated by atrous convolution [30] that can obtain a different perception of the field without changing the amount of computation as shown in Figure 1. However, atrous convolution suffers from the severe problem of losing lo cal information, especially for large null rate and small targets. The hybrid atrous convolution [31] and Deeplab series [21-23] have been developed to effectively alleviate the problem of losing local information.  B.

B. Atrous CNN Encoder  The atrous  CNN encoder is based on the classic spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module [22] to expand receptive fields and extract more scaled image feature based semantic information. However, for complex background obje cts or small targets, the extracted features are neither dense nor detailed enough, resulting in insufficient segmentation. In view of this, in our proposed RSI -Net, improved DenseAtrousCNet is used instead of ASPP to perform down -sampling. DenseAtrousCNet  utilizes a dense connection to cascade a series of atrous convolution and select a suitable atrous rate. By improving the perceptual field while reducing the problems arising from too sparse convolution kernels, DenseAtrousCNet can capture more local info rmation to effectively mitigate the gap local information loss phenomenon.  In this stream of encoder, the feature map from DenseAtrousCNet is then fed into four densely connected atrous convolutions with one 1 1 kernel and three 3 3 kernels with atro us rates of 6, 12, and 18, respectively, as well as an image pooling, in parallel. The features from the above 5 channels are then aggregated and fed into convolution layer with a 3 3 kernel, a stride of 2 for downsamping, and a global average pooling to o btain a dense feature map, followed by a 1 1 convolution for dimensionality reduction.

Atrous convolution is an effective operation to expand receptive field and capture multi -scale contextual information. However, atrous convolution and GCN alone are not effective enough for RSIs, since they often generate large amount of smal l, thin and unclear misclassification objects. Therefore, we design a novel fused decoder based on the output features generated by atrous  CNN and GCN from different perspectives to gradually restore the accurate RSI features. The decoder of the proposed RSI -Net is a fusion of the output of the two encoder streams. The decoder integrates both graph features and high -level as well as low -level image features, as shown in Figure 2 and detailed in Figure 3.

The spatial scale is approximately 2500   2000, with a g round sample distance (GSD) of 9 cm. The ground truth of labeled datasets is divided into six categories: impermeable surfaces, buildings, low vegetation, trees, cars, and clutter/background.  2) POTSDAM DATASET  Potsdam data set (ISPRS, Potsdam 2D Semantic  Labeling Dataset) [45] consists of 38 true orthophoto (TOP) tiles and the corresponding DSMs collected from a historic city with large building blocks.

Evaluation Metrics  Three widely -used evaluation metrics are applied to validate the performance of RSI -Net, i.e., per -class F1 -score, overall accuracy (OA), F1 score, and Cohens kappa coefficient ( ). The OA is calculated as  =++++  (13) where TP denotes the number of positive samples classified correctly, FN positive samples misclassified, FP negative samples misclassified, and TN negative samples classified correctly. The per -class F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision an d recall.  1=2    +  (14) F1 score represents average F1 score of all classes, and a larger F1 score indicated the better performance of the segmentation algorithm.

GCN operates on graph -structure data to obtain global and spatial information, resulting segmentation performance comparable to PSPNet and DeepLab V 3+ but also inferior to RSI -Net.

Since larger superpixels lead to smaller graphs which preserve bigger o bjects and less noise, while smaller superpixels preserve smaller objects and more noise, generally the performance on the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets decreases with the increase of superpixel size due to the fact that"

In contrast, performance on the GID dataset roughly increases with the increase of superpixel size, in accordance with the large proportion of big objects in GID. To prevent the RSI -Net from generating over -smoothed segmentation maps, the sup erpixel size is empirically set to 100 in all experiments in this study, which provides good results for the Vaihigen and Potsdam datasets and acceptable performance for the GID dataset.

Time Cost Comparison  Though PSPNet and DeepLab V3+ perform compa rably to GCN on all three datasets, GCN is computationally  faster while PSPNet and DeepLab V3+ are often criticized  for their high usage of both computation power of memory. Our proposed RSI -Net integrates  both the advantage of GCN using graph -level features and the advantage of PSPNet and DeepLab V3+ of expanded receptive fields to obtain further improved segmentation  while still computationally efficient, as demonstrated in Table 4, where  running time of RSI -Net as well as the state -of-the-art competing methods  are presented for all the three datasets, showing that RSI -Net runs slower than GCN but much faster than all  other competing methods .  C.  Effects of Different Components of RSI -Net In order to explore each streams affecting performance of RSI-Net, we designed four variations. Note that we only analyzed the effects of each component so that the usage of other parameters was referred to previous work. Table V illustrated the OA, avera ge F1 -score and  of RSI -Net based on three datasets.  As listed in Table V, without GCN components, Atrous CNN components or DenseAtrousCNet  components, RSI -Net, precisely, boiled down to a very unstable level, and the OA, average F1 score and "

In  addition, without GCN components or Atrous CNN components, the OA, F1 -score and  of RSI -Net were all affected to a greater or lesser extent. Moreover, GID dataset was more sensitive to GCN components, whereas Vaihingen datasets was more stable. For inst ance, RSI -Net obtained an OA of 93.67% for the GID dataset decreased by 6.64% without GCN components, whereas the OA obtained by the Vaihingen dataset was decreased by only 1.7%. Accordingly, the combination of the all components could be more superior over other variants, and it was more stable on each dataset.  VII. CONCLUSION  Striven to enhance the distinguishability of the correlation between adjacent land covers and to deal with the boundary blur in high -resolution remote sensing images, a novel RSI -Net is proposed and implemented in this paper. First of all, inspired by the ad -vantages of GCN, the graph -based encoder is designed as one key stream to model the pixel -superpixel dependencies to construct the graph, and propagate the contextual in -formation , which effectively produces the enhanced superpixel representations.

owsand robust kinematic expansiveness of vector elds is considered on smoothmanifolds.1.IntroductionLet us start explaining the meaning of kinematic expansiveness discussing a wellknown physical example. Consider the dierential equation of a simple pendulum:+ sin() = 0:It is known since Galileo Galilei that the period of the oscillations isalmost constant if the amplitude is small. But, if T(0) is the period of an oscillationof amplitude 0it can be proved that Tis strictly increasing for 02[0;) (seefor example [5] for a proof). Consider two close initial positions of the pendulumwith vanishing initial velocities. Since the periods of the oscillations are dierent,we have that the solutions will be separated at some time. This is the meaning ofkinematic expansiveness.A key point for a pendulum clock as a practical timekeeper is that this separationtime is large. In fact, it is easy to see that the separation is linear in time. Thisis a special feature of kinematic expansiveness, they are not so chaotic as a systemwith exponential error propagation.In this paper we mainly study dynamical systems on surfaces, therefore we con-sider the usual change of variables x=andy=_, to transform the equation ofthe pendulum into a rst order dierential equation in the plane. Consider two pe-riodic solutions

ow on a compact surface. Precise denitions are givenin the following section.The above considerations are related with the stability (or unstability) of tra-jectories in the sense of Lyapunov. In dynamical systems, another fundamentalconcept is the structural stability due to Andronov and Pontryagin. A system isstructurally stable if there is a neighborhood of the system (in a specied topol-ogy) such that every system of this neighborhood has an equivalent behavior. Inthe discrete time case, two dieomorphisms f;gof a manifold Mare equivalent orconjugated if there is a homeomorphism h:M!Msuch thatfh=hg. In thecontinuous time case, one can say that two

This conceptis very restrictive, because if there is a closed trajectory then its period should bepreserved under perturbations. But this is impossible because slightly changingthe velocities of the system one obtains a small perturbation (on any reasonabletopology) and the periods of the perturbed system are dierent. Therefore, wemust consider the concept of topological equivalence . Two 
ows are topologicallyequivalent if there is a homeomorphism that preserves trajectories and orientations.If the homeomorphism is the identity of the phase space we have that each 
ow is a(global) time change of the other. It is also called a reparametrization of the 
ow.If one is allowed to change the velocities of single trajectories,"
0,Kinematic Expansive flows,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0599v1,Alfonso Artigue,Arxiv,3,"the distance be-tween two whole orbits can be measured with the Fr echet distance . If;:R!Xare continuous curves on a metric space ( X;dist), then the Fr echet or geometricdistance between the curves isdistF(;) = infhsupt2Rdist((t);(t));whereh:R!Rvaries in the set of increasing homeomorphisms of R. This takesus to the concept of geometric expansiveness , that is similar to kinematic expan-siveness but allowing time reparametrizations of trajectories. This concept wasrst considered in the literature by Anosov to prove the structural stability of nowcalled Anosov 
ows.Later, Bowen and Walters introduced a denition of expansive 
ow, see [6], thaton arbitrary compact metric spaces allowed them to prove some properties sharedwith Anosov 
ows. Their denition is of a geometric nature, that is, they requirethat trajectories are separated even allowing time changes of single orbits. In [6] itis noticed that kinematic expansiveness is not enough in order to recover results ofhyperbolic 
ows. In the introduction of cited paper they consider a 
ow topologi-cally equivalent with the pendulum system described above. Some of the results in[6] were generalized in [15] considering dierent families of reparametrizations andacting groups.A dierent and very interesting kind of expansiveness was discovered by Gura.In [11], he proved that the horocycle 
ow of a surface with negative curvatureis positive and negative (kinematic) separating, his denition requires to separateevery pair of points in dierent orbits. He also proved a remarkable result: everyglobal time change of such 
ow is positive and negative kinematic separating. It isknown that horocycle 
ow is not geometric expansive.The aim of this paper is to study kinematic expansiveness."
0,Kinematic Expansive flows,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0599v1,Alfonso Artigue,Arxiv,4,"Examples and basicproperties are mainly stated on compact surfaces. A special feature of kinematicexpansiveness is the non-invariance under global time changes. Therefore we alsoconsider the denition of strong kinematic expansiveness requiring that every globaltime change must be kinematic expansive. A natural question is: why call it strongkinematic and not weak geometric? The answer can be found in the followingexample. Consider Xa vector eld in a two-dimensional torus T2generating anirrational 
ow. Take a non-negative map with just one zero at p2T2. Denethe vector eld Y=Xand letbe its associated 
ow. As we will see, and itsglobal time changes are kinematic expansive. The separation of trajectories is notgeometric because generic orbits are parallel straight lines.This paper is organized as follows.KINEMATIC EXPANSIVE FLOWS 3Section 2. We dene and state the basic properties of expansive and separating
ows in the kinematic, strong kinematic and geometric versions. Examples aregiven to analyze the relationship between the denitions.Section 3. We consider 
ows on compact surfaces. We prove that on surfaces ev-ery geometric separating 
ow is geometric expansive (i.e. k-expansive in the senseof Komuro [17]). We also show that a 
ow on a surface is strong kinematic expan-sive if and only if it is strong separating; and also equivalent with: its singularitiesare of saddle type and the union of the separatrices is dense in the surface.Section 4. We study the kinematic expansiveness of suspension 
ows. We founda dynamical characterization of the topology of compact subsets of the real linerelated with kinematic expansive suspensions. We give a characterization of archomeomorphisms admitting a kinematic expansive suspension. We prove"
0,Kinematic Expansive flows,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0599v1,Alfonso Artigue,Arxiv,5,"that theonlyC1dieomorphism of an interval admitting a kinematic expansive suspensionis the identity. A similar study is done for circle homeomorphisms and dieomor-phisms.Section 5. We consider kinematic expansive 
ows of surfaces. We study therelationship between singularities and kinematic expansiveness in the disc and inthe annulus. We show that every compact surface admits a kinematic expansive
ow.Section 6. For positive geometric expansive 
ows on compact metric spaces it isknown (see [3]) that the dynamic is trivial (a nite number of compact orbits). Thecase of positive kinematic expansiveness is dierent, as is shown in the examplesof this section. We study the local behavior of the 
ow near a compact orbit.On surfaces, we prove that positive expansive 
ows are suspensions and has nosingularities. The smooth case is also considered. We consider a variation of anexample in [16] to show (on a compact metric space) that a positive kinematicexpansive 
ow may not be negative kinematic expansive.Section 7. In this section we consider perturbations of C1kinematic expansivevector elds. We rst give a sucient condition for robust kinematic expansivenessfor conservative vector elds in the annulus. Finally we consider a general manifoldand vector elds without singularities. In this setting we prove that C1-robustkinematic expansiveness implies geometric expansiveness (i.e., expansiveness in thesense of Bowen and Walters [6]).2.Hierarchy of expansive flowsIn this section we present the main denitions. Let ( X;dist) be a compact metricspace and:RX!Xbe a continuous 
ow. We say that p2Xis asingularityor an equilibrium point ofift(p) =pfor allt2R. To understand any denitionof expansive 
ow one must consider the following simple fact.Remark 2.1.It holds that if"

Moreover, the value of smay be as small as we want.Then, if we are going to dene a notion of expansive or separating 
ow we musttake care of points in the same orbit. In the subject of expansive 
ows we considerthe hierarchy shown in Table 1.

Now we give the precisedenitions, examples and counterexamples showing that no arrow in the table canbe reversed in the general setting of compact metric spaces.

ow is illustrated in Figure 2. To show thatis strong kinematic expansive consider any time change of the 
ow. The idea isthe following. Take two points being in dierent local orbits and wait until one ofthem is very close to p. By continuity this point will stay close to pfor a long timewhile the other point will be separated. This argument will be formalized latter inTheorem 3.8.Figure 2. Irrational

A homeomorphism f:I!Iadmits a kinematic expansive sus-pension if and only if the set of periodic points has nitely many components andthe period function is continuous (i.e. in the reversing orientation case, the xedpoint is not accumulated by points of period 2).KINEMATIC EXPANSIVE FLOWS 19Proof. ()) Let us start assuming that fadmits a kinematic expansive suspension.Suppose rst that freverses orientation. As we said fhas a unique xed point p.Now, it is easy to see that xandf(x) contradicts expansiveness if xis a periodicpoint (of period 2) arbitrarily close to p. Assume now that there are innitely manywandering components. We have that for all "" >0 there is a wandering point xsuch that dist( x;fn(x))<""for alln2Z. Consider a time map T:I!R+.

Recall that the sequence zn2fn(I) used to dene the return time Thasthe property fn(zn)!a. Therefore there is n00 such that zn<fn(x)<fn(y)for allnn0.

Keywords: fire model; windstorm; numerical weather prediction; coupled atmosphere fire model; megafire   1. Introduction   3  Wildfire occurrence is punctuated by extreme events - only 3-5% exceed 100 ha in size [1] - yet the largest 1% of fires account for 80-96% of area burned [2,3].  In particular, communities around the world are at risk from large, severe wildfires that threaten people directly and create life-threatening impacts on air quality, water availability and quality, and soil integrity. A new term megafire [4] was coined following the devastating 2000 U.S. wildfire season  to reflect a perception that some wildfires in the U.S., and perhaps worldwide, were reaching new levels in either size, impact on society, or in severity at least in part due to a century of aggressive fire suppression. Indeed, the number of large fires has been increasing in western states[5]. Statistical analyses over broad regions indicate relationships between regional acres burned and conditions intuitively favorable for fire [5,6]. These perceptions have led to widespread attribution of large fires in total and -- more speculatively -- individual fires to climate change and fuel accumulation.   Meanwhile, physically based, mechanistic studies investigating the dynamics producing large, intense fires, confirming such speculations, have been lacking.  Much progress has been made in the broad, interdisciplinary research area of wildland fire science since the 2000 wildfires, particularly in the"

That fire behavior research has been concentrated on a sequence of instrumented small, low intensity prescribed fire field experiments the results of which have had limited applicability to large, high intensity events. Two-dimensional fire models that are based on kinematic relationships between fire behavior and environmental parameters are still broadly used for research, operations, and planning. Though these simpler tools have had wide use and utility in modeling fire spread in simple conditions, often through ad hoc calibration of inputs to obtain observed growth rates,  4 they have been unable to represent complex mountain airflows, transient phenomena, and wildfire events that evolve through dynamic fire-atmosphere interactions - characteristics of the most destructive, highest impact events.  More specifically, the most extreme events frequently lie at an end of a spectrum. At one end, fire growth is driven by strong ambient winds, characterized by practitioners as a ""wind-driven"" event, while at the other end of the spectrum where ambient winds are generally weak, fire growth amplifies due to an internal feedback loop in which winds sometimes ten times stronger than ambient are generated by the heat released by the fire itself, commonly referred to as a ""plume-driven"" event. In such events, media commonly quote fire managers who describe fire behavior as no longer being simple or intuitive but beyond what simple operational models can predict.

Fires in this environment are forged by intricate mountain winds, including winds amplified by the fire itself.  Thus, the complex fire environment, particularly in forested mountainous areas, exceeds current understanding and operational tools, making fires appear unpredictable, increasing uncertainty, and inhibiting the use of prescribed fires that might mitigate the hazard but carry their own uncertainties and risks.  Scientific advances such as coupled numerical weather prediction-wildland fire computational models that capture fire-atmosphere interactions and remote sensing of fires and fuels including quantitative measurements of vegetation structure are transforming fire science. These coupled models have led to better understanding of fire events and phenomena, have reproduced key features during the unfolding of large fire events (e.g., [7]), begun painting a more nuanced picture of how fire environment factors such as fuel amount and condition affect  5 fire behavior (e.g., [8]), and, integrated with satellite active fire detection data, serve as a paradigm for next-generation fire growth forecasting systems (e.g., [9]). Coupled model simulations are broaching operational forecast use but introduce their own uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction, namely, the decrease in their skill with the length of predicted time, limits to predictability that are particularly severe at finer scales, and ambiguities in the interpretation of fire detection and weather data that might be used to assess simulation fidelity.

This section discusses new modeling tools, data sources that may be used to initialize and assess them, and the constraints and limits that accompany these more complex models.  2.1  Wildland fire modeling  Large wildland fires are dynamic, complex phenomena. They encounter a wide range of fuels, terrain, and weather - often during one event - and produce extreme behaviors such as fire whirls, blow-ups, 100-m long bursts of flame shooting ahead of the fire line, fire winds that are ten times stronger than ambient wind speeds, deep pyrocumulus clouds, and firestorms  all resulting from the interactions between a fire and its environment. Despite emergency alert systems and ever improving weather forecasts, communities may be tragically unprepared for complex and explosive fire behavior, for example the 2018 Carr fire firenado, which burned into  7 Redding, CA, and produced 230 km h-1 (143 mph) winds. Indeed, wildfires are often described as unpredictable because human intelligence and current generation fire prediction models cannot integrate all the interacting atmospheric dynamics to anticipate when weather will combine with topography and fuels to dramatically amplify fire behavior.  Current fire modeling tools used in operations [10,11,12] are kinematic, i.e. they relate fire motions to environmental factors without considering the forces that cause the motion and do not model transient behavior and phenomena. Using weather station data, diagnostic wind tools, or gridded weather forecast output, and ad hoc calibration of inputs"

Tarnay",Arxiv,7,"(e.g. [13]) that conceal model limitations to match observed growth rates, these tools have provided estimates of fire growth rate and direction in some simple conditions. The underlying semi-empirical formulae are algebraic relations that express the flaming front rate of spread as the theoretically based rate of spread in zero wind conditions on flat ground, adjusted by empirical factors determined from laboratory and field experiments dependent on the wind speed at midflame height and terrain slope. These relations have been criticized for assumptions regarding their representation of combustion and inadequacies when tested against real fires using nearby winds. However, the more coupled sophisticated models described in 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 that use these semi-empirical relationships as parameterizations at large scales in dynamic models have shown they do capture key sensitivities - how fire rate of spread responds to environmental factors of fuel, wind, and slope - and can represent fire behavior, phenomena, and event evolution well when the temporal and spatial variability of wind including fire-induced winds from the fire are calculated accurately at microscales (100s of meters). This can be scientifically and computationally challenging, but is within the grasp of some computational modeling systems.  8  2.1.1 Computational aspects of coupled atmosphere-fire modeling  A newer generation of models couple a fire behavior or combustion physics module with a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.

The latter (CAWFE [16,17], WRF-based systems such as WRF-Fire [18] and derivatives, and the Unified Model [19]) are based on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) CFD models, include additional variables and processes representing phase changes, large-scale weather patterns, and grid refinement over nested domains potentially spanning the globe and parameterize fire processes, which occur at scales much finer than the resolution typically used to model weather(thousands to tens of thousands of meters grid spacing). These NWP-based coupled weather-fire models do not represent combustion details but instead see the fire as a spatially and temporally varying heat and moisture source, an approach that results (e.g. [9]) have shown  can sufficiently capture fire event dynamics using one to a few hundred meters grid spacing by capturing convective-scale winds induced by topography and the fire itself.  Each type is best suited for different types of fire modeling problems [20]. The sets of equations composing each system consist of fundamental rules governing the physics of fluids - the second law of thermodynamics, the ideal gas law, a statement of mass conversation, and equations describing the rate of change of momentum and scalars including mass concentrations of atmospheric water phases [21]. Consequently, this coupling achieved through computational  9 models - as the heat and water vapor released by the fire create a buoyant updraft over the air, drawing air in at its base to replace air rising in the"

Accompanying side effects include more complexity, the requirement for computational weather model knowledge, greater computational resources, and the decrease in skill with time and limits to predictability that accompany NWP models. The last issue is an important constraint on coupled weather-fire simulations because the rapid error growth associated with the required one to a few hundred meters grid spacing limits simulations to one to two days, or less in meteorological or fire conditions where uncertainty increases rapidly [20]. Key to the computational solution for fire growth in a coupled system is the underlying NWP model.  Numerical weather prediction models are often designed for simulation of specific scales of atmospheric motion, from coarse synoptic scales, through mesoscale simulations (with the finest horizontal grid spacing of 2-20 km), convective scales (hundreds of meter - a few kilometers grid spacing), and even finer turbulence scales. NWP models have been used for decades to simulate weather phenomena that are also linked to critical wildland fire behavior - atmospheric convection, cloud production, outflows, gust fronts, and microbursts, mountain circulations, and downslope windstorms. Though NWP models may solve the same set of equations, different approximations, solution methods, and discretization can produce solutions with different"

For example, the WRF model produces an atmospheric energy spectrum that adheres closely to the  10 expected natural spectra across synoptic and mesoscales [22], but components included to reduce numerical divergence severely dissipate fine-scale motions and smooth fine-scale gradients. Studies have shown this has led to underestimates in peak wind extrema in wind-driven fire events [23], smoothed gradients across interfaces precluding WRF from producing gravity wave overturning (discussed in Coen 2018) - a primary mechanism for producing strong downslope winds driving fire events such as the 2012 High Park Fire [24] and shear instabilities [25], and smoothing gradients underlying simulation of the full development of fire phenomena such as fire whirls [20,26].   2.1.2 CAWFE  The CAWFE modeling system (derived from Coupled Atmosphere-Wildland Fire Environment) combines a numerical weather prediction model with a module describing fire behavior and fuel consumption. The weather and fire components are coupled so that fluxes of heat and water vapor from the fire alter the state of the atmosphere, notably producing fire winds, and the evolving atmospheric state affects fire behavior. CAWFE is built upon the three-dimensional time-dependent meteorological Clark-Hall model [27,28], the solution methods and options of which were designed to excel at very fine scales (~100 m grid spacing) in extremely complex terrain. Vertically stretched terrain-following coordinates allow detailed simulation of airflow at horizontal resolutions of tens of kilometers while telescoping in to focus at hundreds of meters in the area of a fire.

One algorithm predicts how fast the flaming front of a surface fire will spread in wildland fuel complexes [29], as a function of terrain, fuel properties and moisture state, and wind, which may be altered by the fire. The limits to direct use of Rothermels semi-empirical relationship [29] for fire spread are well known but when used with fire-induced winds - the importance of which was not recognized until the 1990s -- it has proven very successful, likely because the response to increases in wind speed - the dominant factor - and slope are based on empirically derived relationships. Additional algorithms calculate how rapidly fuel complexes behind the flaming front are consumed depending on their size composition [30], whether the surface fire is intense enough to ignite and transition to the canopy, if present, and how fast the subsequent crown fire would spread [31]. As fuel is consumed by the surface and crown fires, sensible and latent heat is released as well as smoke particulates (or other chemical species) via an emission factor. A radiation treatment distributes sensible and latent heat fluxes and particulates from the fire into the lowest atmospheric grid volumes.

As a coupled computational modeling system, it provides a physically-based, internally consistent link between fuels, weather, terrain, and the fire behavior, intensity, and effects that result. For example, spatial maps of simulated heat flux were used to investigate if remotely sensed fuel properties could improve predictions of burn severity during studies of the King Fire [8,32]. Simulations have reproduced transient fire phenomena such as horizontal roll vortices (HRVs), splitting or merging of the fire line, fire whirls, rotating  12 convective columns, multiple convective plumes along a fire line, sudden changes in fire direction, pyrocumuli, and blowups.

The 2017 launch of a second instrument augmented VIIRS biomass burning mapping capabilities. In addition to VIIRS, a fire detection algorithm was developed for Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) 30 m resolution imagery [38] and implemented operationally at the USFS Geospatial Technology and Applications Center.

Mapping and interpreting fire behavior and extent in some fires, particularly some with the highest impact, remains challenging. Current fire mapping data is problematic for studying fires at times in between observations, for fast moving fires that may have ignited and reached tens of thousands of acres by the time of first observation (such as recent northern California wind-driven events or High Plains range fires), and for representing the important diurnal variability in fire growth that is not captured in twice-daily observations. Rapidly moving fires in the southwest in sparse fuels over hard soils may not retain enough heat signature to be detected. Also, associated variables needed for analysis but which are not easily observed (such as the near instantaneous rate of spread versus a many-hour or daily average between consecutive observations) are not recorded.  Post-processing of high-speed airborne infrared data [40] has been used to extract rate of spread in naturally burning fires.

Standards for siting stations [43] consider general requirements (meteorological variables, location, sampling frequency, and timing) for installing stations in view of the application areas for which data is needed, for example, NWS stations are often co-located with airports and RAWS stations are located where they can monitor fire danger. Siting is constrained by land physical characteristics (e.g. avoiding where trees or terrain may disrupt airflows) and land ownership and access, sometimes limiting stations to non-optimal siting at accessible locations where land is owned by the public or a cooperative private entity. Set amidst forested terrain, stations may experience blocking from certain wind sectors. The distance between stations, especially in the western U.S., remote areas, and wilderness where it may be tens of kilometers, is problematic for wildfire applications. Neither network is targeted for detecting microscale variability in complex terrain or where winds may disproportionately impact the electrical grid.

Current activities and the California utilities wildfire mitigation plans include dramatic supplementation of the existing weather station network. These promise greater situational awareness and better anticipation of weather events that, when interacting with the grid, may ignite fires or spread fires that impact the utility infrastructure and other assets at risk. Remaining issues relate to validation of weather prediction models and the use of surface weather station data to do so. The user community implicitly assumes that weather station data resolves the essential nature of airflow, building upon the longstanding assumption that smaller-scale motions are weak and unimportant, and that, despite the terrain variability, weather model simulations (where grid point predictions represent averages over the grid volume and time step) with effective resolutions of several kilometers can be directly compared against station measurements; agreement is interpreted as success while disagreement is attributed to ""gusts"" not represented by the spatial or"

Direct comparison between surface measurements and model predictions is additionally complicated in that some vertical displacement is required between the model grid point and measurement height.  It is assumed that standard profiles for how the along-surface wind speed varies with height in the atmospheric surface layer (a log profile) or atmospheric boundary layer (a power law), however, none of the  18 assumptions underlying derivation of those profiles are satisfied in these airflows (that the airflow is stationary, the terrain is flat, and that the air is neutrally stratified), thus, it is expected that the vertical variation of wind speed can vary substantially from these assumed profiles.   Subsequent studies with models suitable for finer-scale simulations have suggested the presence of various types of coherent, dynamic microscale phenomena largely unexplored in the scientific literature; these phenomena create local extrema with peaks 5-10 m s-1 higher and time series of wind speeds produce oscillations of 4-13 minutes [7,23], a frequency noted in station data reported at high frequency, the mechanism for which has not been explained.

Applications  19 In this section, we synthesize some recent studies to give insight on some overarching fire research issues and the new generation of computational weather - wildland fire models being used to address them, such as what causes distinct types of outlier fires. We also discuss applications, such as identifying situations with potential for large fire growth, fire growth forecasting, and how studies of transient fire behavior are being used to improve firefighter safety. In typical use, a coupled weather-fire simulation is initialized and the boundary conditions later updated with large-scale atmospheric analyses (for past events) or forecasts (for future events).  The fire is initialized either at its known ignition time and location or, for later periods in the fire, initialized in progress using a fire perimeter. From then, 12-36 h periods of interactive weather and fire growth can be simulated well until fidelity has degraded due to the accumulation of errors.

Extensions include the connection to model fire effects, such as to atmospheric chemistry modules for modeling air quality effects [44] or the calculation of burn severity [8,32]. Some studies have used idealized studies to address basic aspects of fire behavior, e.g. [45], and sensitivities [18].  Numerous studies target model validation, e.g. [46], while others sought understanding for aspects of fire behavior, e.g. [7], or overall event growth, e.g. [24]. There remains misunderstanding about why a particular fire became large and what factors in the fire environment were important; few events have been scrutinized with physically-based studies.    20  3.1 Investigating physical mechanisms behind extreme fires   The most extreme events frequently lie at either end of a spectrum. At one end, fire growth is driven by strong ambient winds, characterized by practitioners as a ""wind-driven"" event, while at the other end of the spectrum, fire growth amplifies due to an internal feedback loop in which winds are generated by the heat released by the fire itself, commonly referred to as a ""plume-driven"" event. Coupled modeling studies, as described below, have allowed investigators to deconstruct events, identifying the physical mechanisms that lead to exceptional fires, and interpret distinct periods and regions of each type of behavior within vast, complex, long-lasting events.  3.1.1   Plume-driven"

Tarnay",Arxiv,22,"megafires  Public alerts such as Red Flag Warnings address the potential for large wildfires in terms of external environmental factors, emphasizing extreme conditions. These overlook the potential for rapid growth in unexceptional conditions, where ignition in a fortuitous location finds fuel and terrain ingredients for rapid growth even in weak winds. In addition, despite the perception that long-term impacts such as drought govern fire behavior, research [47] suggests short-term weather has more effect. Fire growth is generally episodic, tied to few day period of favorable weather conditions. For example, Peterson et al. (2015) [48] found the two days of rapid growth during the 2013 Rim Megafire were a disastrous consequence of southwesterly winds nudging an ignition at the base of inclined canyons and a second day when fortuitously aligned  21 southwesterly winds fanned its rapid growth further up into the bowl, creating a pyrocumulus cloud [49] that may have enhanced fire growth. (They did not have means to assess the magnitude of fire induced winds.)  Winds within a wildfire may greatly exceed ambient conditions, in some cases by a factor of ten [50] and be of tornadic strength. Current kinematic operational tools poorly represent plume-driven fires because fire spread is generated by internal dynamics, not ambient winds. Particularly on inclined terrain, fire-induced winds have the potential to greatly accelerate fires, an effect that may be channeled and focused by topography (i.e. the chimney effect). An example is the 2014 King fire, which typifies the difficulty in anticipating fire behavior in complex terrain where"

The 2014 King Fire occurred amidst a prolonged drought in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Following several days of slow growth through rolling hills in weak southwesterlies , the fire entered the base of the Rubicon River Valley and, while nearby weather stations recorded weak to moderate winds like previous days, raced 25 km in one afternoon to the top of  the canyon (Fig. 2a). CAWFE simulations [8] reproduced the rapid growth (Fig. 2b), smoke transport (Fig. 2c), and phenomena including multiple heading regions as fingers of rapid growth found favorable topographic niches to draw themselves up as the fire travelled over rolling hills approaching the canyon and a pyrocumulus cloud in the plume over the fire's heading region. Coupled systems can explore broader questions about what factors were important in causing such an exceptional event and how they might be mitigated. For example, additional simulations used CAWFE to disentangle the mechanisms causing rapid growth. To reveal the magnitude of fire-induced winds, a second experiment without a fire was conducted, and the west-east, south-north, and up-down components of air velocity in one experiment are subtracted  22 from the other, revealing the location and magnitude of the fires impact on the winds. This showed fire-induced winds during the King Fire were on the order of or exceeded ambient winds [8], and, along with a fine-scale wind circulations beneath the resolution of weather station data within the Rubicon Canyon, were responsible for the unanticipated growth.

Thus, a broader implication is that, in such fires, fuel mitigation might be prioritized on slopes, where it could have the biggest impact in limiting fire behavior. And like many fires of this type, these factors had no opportunity to affect size, because though they might modulate fire spread rate, the extent was limited by rocky terrain. Part of needed research includes re-examining beliefs arising from legacy kinematic models, for example, that megafires require extreme fuel loads - a fire community perception perhaps arising from kinematic models inability to create extreme rates of spread without artificially adjusting fuel loads to extreme values. Similar assumptions are widely held that beetle killed-trees, which have lost moisture in their crowns and therefore are presumed to be more flammable, are at risk for more intense fire behavior but [24] showed the 2012 High Park megafires growth was not enhanced by beetle kill and that through generating a more intense plume, might somewhat hinder downward spread in fires driven downslope by strong winds.  Researchers have developed growing interest in pyrocumulus clouds (e.g. [49]) because of the potential for precipitation to influence fire behavior and because deep plumes may inject smoke into the stratosphere, affecting its radiative and chemical properties.

Wind-driven megafires   Large, high-impact fires can occur when strong wind events overlap sufficiently dry conditions. Several of the most destructive recent U.S. wildfire events were associated with strong downslope winds in the lee of mountain ridges, where winds are variously referred to as Santa Anas in southern California, Diablo winds in northern California, chinooks (unseasonal July Colorado Front Range downslope windstorms), or the more general term fehn winds for cross barrier flow in the eastern U.S. Appalachian Mountains. In addition, numerous events may be associated with broad areas of strong winds associated with synoptic-scale events such as pre-frontal, frontal, or pre-hurricane winds driving massive range fires in the south central U.S. plains or, in the late 1800s, the Great Lakes region.  In the case of the topographically-tied events, while an underlying synoptic-scale pressure gradient driving winds from high to low pressure invariably sets up a wind event, the mechanics establishing exceptionally strong winds - determined by flow parameters including the terrain aspect ratio (height divided by half-width), wind speed, and atmospheric stability - can vary greatly between events and locations. The strength and gustiness of one of the most studied regimes, Colorado Front Range windstorms, have been explained in terms of (1) an imperfect analogy to a hydraulic jump [51] of a stream, (2) reflection of upwardly propagating atmospheric gravity waves from a critical level [52,53] where a"

(An example of a CAWFE simulation of gravity wave overturning and breaking during the High Park Fire is shown in Fig. 3.)  Analytical solutions exist for only a few idealized problems, thus, research in airflow over complex terrain has relied upon computational modeling.  Mountain waves and related airflows around the world have been studied with NWP models. Two that have been applied to wildfire cases are the Clark-Hall atmospheric model (the basis of CAWFE) and WRF (the basis of WRF-Fire and derivatives). Computational modeling has been used to address current issues relating to the impact of wind events on the California electrical system and subsequent fires - events that have in the past several years caused several multi-billion dollar events.  Investigations have attributed the ignition of several recent fires (the 2007 Santa Ana-driven Witch and Guejito Fires in southern California, the 2017 North Bay Fires in northern California, the 2017 Thomas Fire, and the 2018 Camp Fire) to utility malfunctions that occurred during strong wind events. A primary issue was the magnitude of peak winds, as utilities are required to maintain and clear lines of vegetation to withstand winds of approximately 25 m s-1. In 2019, utilities"

A second issue has been the nature of the airflow regime itself. Because of the sparse observation network and lack of very high resolution studies of fire-related windstorms in that area, mechanisms associated with strong lee slope winds were not known. Case studies have simulated the airflow and, in application of coupled weather-fire models, fire growth associated with several of these events.  Simulations at sub-kilometer grid  25 spacing using the mesoscale WRF model, for example, simulated the Witch Fire's acceleration down the lee slopes in San Diego County [56] the Tubbs Fire [57,58] (Fig. 4), and the Camp Fire [59]. In each case, the flow shows acceleration on lee slopes and resembles a hydraulic jump with some steepening of potential temperature surfaces, with modeled winds of 25-31 m s-1. These show the success of mesoscale models applied at high resolution in identifying areas of strong winds, though they are very smooth, despite intricate topographical variations, and additional 'gust factors' are necessary to explain measured winds or wind damage that exceed these values. Additionally, WRF's severe dissipation of fine-scale motions has detrimental effects on reproducing sub-kilometer motions, precluding simulation of processes that require resolving fine-scale gradients, notably wave breaking, leading to underestimates in predicted wind speed [20]. Thus, these studies leave unanswered the questions: What are the mechanisms for exceptionally strong winds and where specifically might these occur? "

Protuberances on the southern flank, seen in active fire detection data (Fig. 5b), can be attributed to the fire drawing itself up topographic features. Further north, the Redwood Valley Fire (Fig. 6a) occurred when the pressure gradient drove air over a lower barrier in the Sierras, creating a shallow, narrow river of high speed air (Fig. 6b and 6c) that reportedly caused both ignitions of the Redwood Valley Fire (Fig. 6d) and its subsequent deadly run (Fig. 6e and 6f).

A velocity difference across the interface between the vertically stratified fluid occurred as the near-surface river of stable air was lifted into slower moving air, crests of high momentum air retroflected (crashed backwards) and down to the surface, bringing gusts that drove the fire downslope. Significantly, WRF simulations of the weather during this event [59] produced only some supercritical flow over the upper slopes (Fig. 8d) and though VIIRS observations show the fire extent having descended the slopes and entering Paradise by late morning, similarly configured simulations of this event using WRF-based coupled weather-fire models (unpublished results, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpm0nq4rhdU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2XG0CNHMEk), did not produce this shear instability, did not drive the fire down the mountain, and predicted that even after three days the Camp fire would never have reached the town of Paradise. Thus, coupled weather-fire simulations configured similarly, which differ primarily in the underlying NWP model, may give dramatically different results.   Extreme fires associated with downslope winds are not limited to the mountainous western United States and southern Europe.

The surprisingly rapid fire spread (CAWFE simulation shown in Fig. 9c) followed the localized pulsing downslope winds down the north face of the Smoky Mountains to where and when the strong wind zone ended.  Again, compared to the actual growth (Fig. 10a), and CAWFE simulations (Fig. 10b), WRF-based coupled weather-fire simulations of the event [60] (Fig. 10c) produced strong winds that underestimated the event and underpredicted fire extent by a factor of 10-20, predicting the fire never approached Gatlinburg, TN.

As forecast guidance, we see that different underlying computational weather models can produce starkly different results, suggesting a key area for additional computational science investigations.  Current research focusses on fire spread in the wildland urban interface and on the role of embers (e.g., [61]). Embers have been identified as a key mechanism in structure ignition. They can also play many different roles in fire spread in wildlands, either through long-distance spotting of individual embers, short/medium distance spotting ahead of the fire line where they may or may not be overrun by flaming front before can create a plume of their own that draws the original fire forward.

In complex situations, traditional fire behavior tools and knowledge have left investigators speculating about complex interactions between fire, weather, and terrain.  This distinction is important because without comprehensive understanding of what actually produced an event, we cannot recognize and mitigate controllable factors to prevent it from happening again.   Some events most challenging to understand are complex wildfire events that develop both plume-driven and wind-driven heading regions.

The massive 2017 Thomas Fire occurred in southern California during an extended, two-week long Santa Ana event. The progression map (Fig. 11) highlights how complex and mixed  29 the factors driving fire behavior can be, showing that the first and sixth days accounted for most growth, mostly east to west, while on days in between, the fire spread laterally into topography to the north and south. Large-scale weather forecasts and VIIRS observations were used to initialize a sequence of CAWFE simulations covering a six day period in order to deconstruct the fire-driving mechanisms [632The simulations showed that both ignitions and the first period of fire growth occurred in a shallow river of extreme Santa Ana-driven flow south west down the Santa Clara River Valley (Fig. 12a-c).  For several days, while Santa Anas are reported in the area, the fire then spread laterally (Fig. 13a-c), drawing itself up canyons orthogonal to the wind, where the fire was sheltered from the Santa Anas and in other places enhanced by topographically channeled winds. In some periods, it created deep plumes that rapidly pulled it up north-south aligned drainages and bowls. The Santa Ana strength waxed and waned, the areas that experienced winds varied with time, and during the second rapid growth period, the Santa Anas surfaced in areas where the fire had reached, again creating a wind driven period west"

Computational modeling of this event was extremely challenging due to the vast size, the numerical challenges of reproducing very fast airflow through extremely sharp, steep, highly varying terrain, compounding errors, and urban and firefighting effects on fire behavior.  3.2 Fire Management and Mitigation Applications   The most obvious use of models such as CAWFE is in anticipating where and how fast a fire will grow in the future. We discuss this use and others with potentially greater impact - identifying underestimated locations and conditions that, should a fire start, could, through  30 dynamic interactions, lead to rapid fire growth and testing mitigation strategies in complex landscapes.   3.2.1 Fire growth forecasting  The coupling of NWP models to fire behavior modules allowed researchers to simulate the evolution of fire events with much greater fidelity and introduced the possibility of their use as forecasting systems operationally for fire management. However, forecasting still had several challenges.  First, the skill in NWP forecasts decreases with time, such that short-term forecasts may be accurate, but as the length of the forecast increases, errors increase; in fine-scale forecasts such as are used here, the forecast may only be useful for 1-3 days. In contrast, a fire event might continue for several weeks, thus, a single simulation could not accurately encompass a fire event. Secondly, some aspects of fire growth are inherently unpredictable. For example, the spotting process whereby embers lofted ahead of a fire where they may ignite another fire, contains several"

Thirdly, as an event progresses, firefighters interfere with natural fire growth (what models simulate) with suppression, altering natural fire growth. These issues hindered advances until new data enabled a new era in fire growth forecasting. In simulations of events that occurred after the Suomi/NPP launch in 2011, a map of clearly delineated fire extent from the VIIRS instruments active fire detection product could be used as initialization, to introduce the fire already in progress into a running CAWFE simulation, and also to evaluate simulations. Coen and Schroeder (2013) [9] presented a cycling forecasting approach, in which a sequence of CAWFE forecasts could be initialized using updated weather  31 and VIIRS fire maps.  In this approach, a sequence of simulations is initialized with new active fire detection data from VIIRS, and each simulation continued in time. As a new forecast becomes available, it is used as guidance and, the previous forecast, in which errors will have accumulated, is discarded.  In principle, this allows fire growth to be simulated well for the next 1-3 days from the time the fire is first detected by satellite until it is extinguished. In practice, both additional challenges and advantages arise [63].  For example, the cycling approach may provide a poor forecast if highly unpredictable weather occurs (for example, convective initiation) and the forecast deteriorates before another observation is available or if a fire observation is missing (e.g. the data collection is obscured by clouds, ruined by"

Those obstacles are balanced by the availability of new sensors the observations of which not only allow for asynchronous new forecasts to be added, perhaps improving the overall system skill by keeping the current forecast more up to date, but, given a detection closer to ignition, as in the Canyon Creek Wildfire [63], allow the forecast system to start simulations and guide response earlier.    CAWFE has also been configured as a deterministic forecast, in which it is fast enough to produce a forecast for a large fire (innermost domain 26 km x 26 km), for example, the Tubbs Fire, four times faster than real time on a single processor [23]. Simple prototype coupled systems, with simulations manually triggered at notification of a new fire, have been demonstrated in [64-67], where WRF-based systems [65-67] employ hundreds - thousands of processors.  More recent applications have used CAWFE to downscale operational forecasts in October 2019 during forecasted Diablo and Santa Ana wind events in northern and southern California respectively, to see if it is possible to more precisely identify extreme wind locations [62] and refine PSPSs.  32   3.2.2 Results of applications to land management in complex environments  In forested mountain environments, fire is a natural disturbance and prescribed fire the tool of choice for reducing fuel load and restoring lands to a healthy condition.

Unplanned prescribed fire escapes have been costly, sometimes costing lives, reducing public acceptance of this mitigation technique despite awareness of a building wildfire potential. Only a small percentage of areas needing treatment are completed. In this environment, current operational fire modeling tools are particularly challenged, making fires appear unpredictable, increasing uncertainty, and inhibiting greater use of prescribed fires that might mitigate the hazard. A key application of coupled models is in investigating the potential for large fire growth in such complex environments Fine-scale topographic effects on wind, microscale circulations, and fire-induced winds are less well appreciated among the forestry community than more tangible factors such as fuel loads and moisture, yet these may trigger branching of fire behavior into very different outcomes. Tarnay et al. (2018) [68] used CAWFE simulations to assess the risk of large fire potential from four hypothetical ignitions along the North Yuba River (Fig. 14) in Tahoe National Forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the weak southwesterly wind conditions of Sept. 17, 2014 (the day on which the King Fire, 75 km to the south, ran 25 km (Section 3.1.1)).  Ignitions #1, #2, and #4 produced small fires over the first 12 h burning period. Ignition #3, at the town of Goodyears Bar, CA, lay at the intersection of a north-south canyon and the river valley, allowing winds to penetrate down into the valley and fan the ignition. This nudged it into  33 the inclined north-south canyon, where the plume it produced drew air in across"

This highlighted the alarming potential for severe fires in conditions that do not themselves appear severe, such as the potential for megafires in the Sierras during common autumn weak southwesterly winds and the very different outcomes that could arise from ignitions in close proximity due to local topographic effects.  Computational models are uniquely able to show that in these complex environments, there can be greater variability than imagined in potential fire growth due to subtle differences in the fire environment or perhaps counterintuitive (in the case of previous beetle kill impacts on live fuel load [24]) results when considered in a dynamic framework.  3.3 Transient phenomena: Drawing knowledge to enhance firefighter safety   Firefighters are vulnerable to complex, transient dynamic fire phenomena as well as perfect storm scenarios where numerous fuel, local topographic wind effects, fire amplification as it is channeled though canyons, and feedbacks between the wind and fire come together. Albini (1984) [69] described the state of knowledge of fire behavior and fire phenomena at the time, emphasizing the uncertainty and some hypotheses about how they occurred, particularly transient phenomena. A notable example that still poses a safety hazard are fire vortices, which may range from the small meter-sized fire whirls along a fire line to firenadoes that spin off an actively burning fire potentially with damaging winds of tornadic strength, to situations where the entire plume over a"

Fire whirls themselves  34 are identified as an example of extreme fire behavior indicating direct suppression should be stopped. Rotating plumes have proven to be safety problems, for example, during the 2008 Indians Fire, as the rotating convective column swept over a crew seeking shelter in and behind an engine, the flames curling around the vehicle. A similar event occurred during the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, as a firenado spun off the primary convective column across a dry lakebed that had been designated a safety zone. The Carr Fire, in which a confluence of downslope westerly winds intersected northerly flow up the Sacramento Valley, produced a shear zone across which a fire line with rapid consumption of heavy fuels combined to produce a firenado 5.5 km tall, 300 m wide, with winds exceeding 230 km h-1 - a phenomena that threw a firefighters truck over 500 m. Images of the Carr Fire tornado were analyzed by [71]. Pulsing or collapsing motions of the convective column over a fire are anecdotally connected to sudden amplification or other changes in fire behavior, though science has not yet unraveled this. Research is still exploring how, where, or how frequently such phenomena may occur on large wildland fires.   Investigation of fire phenomena is at the forefront of computational modeling of fire behavior. Simulations have begun to capture more complex"

CAWFE simulations of  the Esperanza Fire [7] produced a 1-km wide firenado on the upslope flank and horizontal roll vortices (HRVs) (pairs of counter-rotating updrafts laid forward on their side) that formed where northeasterly winds driving the fire met southwesterly winds at the fire line providing the horizontal wind gradient needed (when lifted by the fire convective column) to generate rotation around a vertical axis. These atmospheric phenomena impact fire behavior, as HRVs increased (decreased) the fire rate of spread in between vortices where  35 downdrafts (updrafts), respectively, coincided.  Some of the most hazardous and difficult to anticipate behavior arises when precipitation falling from a cloud evaporates as it falls, cooling the subcloud air, and generates a cool gust front that spreads outwards. These outflow boundaries can persist for 24 hours and travel over a hundred kilometers. When an outflow boundary encounters a fire, shifting winds can rapidly change the intensity and direction of spread. This is exemplified by the 2013 Yarnell Hill Fire, which resulted in 19 firefighter deaths. While current training materials emphasize the outflows from thunderstorms, small, nearly transparent clouds (known as virga) may produce strong downdrafts and outflows as well. The Frog fire (1 fatality) was believed to have been influenced by the collapse of several small cells that produced multiple wind shifts. Some outflow winds may be generated by the pyrocumulus clouds formed by the"

Early analysis suggests that precipitation falling from the cloud evaporated as it fell, cooling the subcloud air, and generated a gust front that without warning spread the fire downslope an additional 20,000 ha overnight when weather conditions suggested no growth would occur.  Gust front-driven fire behavior cases are some of the most difficult to reproduce with computational models due to the need to accurately represent the location and timing of a sequence of events: convection initiation, the onset, production, and descent of precipitation, gust front propagation, its impact with the fire, and subsequent fire behavior. Fig. 15 (adapted from [21]) shows the reported progression and the innermost computational domain of a CAWFE simulation of the Yarnell Hill Fire. On the day of the fatality, southwesterly winds crossed central Arizona, pushing an existing fire north, where it encountered a westerly gap flow, turning it east, as seen in the report's map of fire progression (Fig. 15, left). Simultaneously, a high-based  36 tongue of moist air from the Pacific northwest had begun crossing a series of mountains in northeast Arizona, triggering thunderstorms. As their rain fell into a dry boundary layer, it evaporated, creating a gust front that spread to the southwest. The gust front encountered the fire, changing the direction it was spreading from slowly towards the east to rapidly toward the southwest, driving it over the sheltered firefighters. Subsequent investigation suggests a pyrocumulus over the"

Though firefighters are given warnings that thunderstorm outflows of a particular strength are likely in an afternoon, specific warnings on particular features are not done.  In part, this reflects the difficulty in predicting specifics of convective initiation, but also reflects the inability of current kinematic operational fire behavior models to simulate this sort of event. This event exemplifies where a coupled numerical weather predictionfire behavior model can advance understanding and firefighter safety beyond current fire modeling tools, by linking the fire behavior, the cloud it generates, the precipitation that falls from the cloud, the gust front this produces, and the resulting feedback on fire behavior.  4. Conclusions   The recognition that much of the current complexity surrounding wildland fires arise from their interaction with the fluid surrounding them has led to an expansion in the use of computational models.  These models' uses range from basic understanding of fire behavior, investigation into the causes of extreme events, more sophisticated forecasting systems based on perceptions that current kinematic models no longer suffice, to developing training material on this new understanding for firefighters.  Here, we have synthesized recent studies using  37 convective-scale (hundreds of meters horizontal grid spacing) simulations of the weather leading up to and early fire growth during recent wildfire events with the CAWFE coupled weather-wildland fire modeling system, and others for comparison, using satellite active fire detection data from the Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite"

Taken as a whole, they provide insight on current wildland fire issues and areas of progress.  Computational science is bringing dramatic advances and technology to this important hazard. For example, it is slowly changing widely repeated, firmly believed misunderstanding about causes of why a fire became large and what factors are important. Firefighters speak of a dichotomy of plume-driven vs. wind-driven fire behavior; most extreme events frequently lie at each end of this spectrum. However, studies of events like the 2006 Esperanza Fire or the 2017 Thomas Fire have shown a single fire may have both wind- and plume-driven components, the location and timing of which vary throughout an event due to changing of synoptic pressure pattern, how winds are oriented with respect to topography, and how topography alters, blocks, or shelters certain areas. During a wind-driven event, components of the fire can spread rapidly orthogonal to wind - a development that in those cases led to firefighter fatalities. The largest or most destructive fires can occur due to or along with exceptional atmospheric extremes (e.g. during California or Colorado wind events), others do not require extreme conditions, and arise from a fortuitous alignment of small, local factors. Fire behavior may yet surprise due to the lack of apparent ambient triggers visible in surface weather station network data or coarse operational NWP model forecasts - most often during plume-driven fires due to fire-induced winds arising from internal dynamics or aided by undetectable microscale"

Computational science studies have allowed the  38 testing of ""what if"" scenarios, testing the impact of various factors on an event, sometimes providing counterintuitive answers, for example, that despite occurring within a drought or in forests experiencing built up fuels, these factors, though dead fuel moisture and fuel load effects, have secondary effect except on fires climbing inclined especially concave terrain slopes, where the factors can reinforce each other through the atmospheric medium.  In plume-driven events, studies showed that the actual potential for large fire growth may be much greater or less (depending on the location) than previous studies using kinematic models indicated. Extreme fires can occur during conditions (weather) that are not extreme and the primary factors shaping the fire and driving the rapid growth (microscale circulations and fire-induced winds) may not be apparent. Other factors (such as fuel moisture and loads) may only have noticeable impact where fires are growing upslope, where the factors may reinforce each other. Microscale factors such as small topographic features and aspects due to chance such as ignition location with respect to topographic features can make or break large fire growth in otherwise similar conditions through internal dynamic interactions.

In and of themselves, they have underestimated the peak winds by 5-10 m s-1 in their direct simulations, though users claim success by augmenting outcomes using ""gust factors"" to reach desired results. Assessing simulation-based claims of peak winds using longstanding NWS and RAWS surface station networks has been challenging, as complex terrain creates high spatial and temporal variability, and their placement was not targeted toward high wind extrema  39 locations. (This perhaps increases the challenge for emerging machine learning approaches, in that though wind is the most critical environmental factor driving fire growth, wind data capture neither the fine-scale topographic flows nor fire-induced winds that drive fire behavior.)  However, in several cases, ignitions and rapid early fire growth appear linked to strong winds and local extrema. Along with destruction, anecdotal evidence, and surface weather stations placed in California by utility companies in areas focused on wind corridors, have since detected higher gusts reaching 30-45 m s-1.   However, when the operational NWP forecasts are used as initial and boundary conditions and downscaled with CAWFE, simulations generate microscale phenomena and wind extrema comparable to newer utility weather stations and distinctive features and characteristics of fire growth, including both wind-driven and fire-induced wind plume-driven components. While these wind features are small, sub-mesoscale circulations, they are not weak nor merely 'gusts', but resolvable dynamic phenomena with extreme wind speed peaks, often located near ignitions attributed by investigative reports to utility equipment faults.

0,Spectrum Sensing: Enhanced Energy Detection Technique Based on Noise Measurement,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05118v1,Youness Arjoune,Arxiv,2," Cognitive radio technology has been proposed as a smart solution to enhance the access to the radio spectrum and solve the problem of its scarcity [1, 2]. Cognitive radio systems enable the detection of unused spectrum holes, and allow secondary users to use them while avoiding interferences to the primary user (PU). To enable dynamic spectrum access, these systems perform spectrum sensing to decide on the presence or absence of the primary user [2, 3]. Several sensing techniques have been proposed to sense the radio spectrum including energy detection [4-8], autocorrelation [9-12], and matched filter based sensing [13,14].  Energy detection [4-8] computes the energy of the received N samples as the squared magnitude of the FFT averaged over these N samples and compares it to a threshold to obtain the sensing decision. If this energy is higher than this threshold, then the primary user is deemed to be present; otherwise, the primary user signal is considered absent. This technique is simple as it does not require any prior information about the primary user signal, which makes it much more straightforward than matched filter and autocorrelation sensing technique [5]. However, the performance of this technique is highly dependent on the noise which is random [6]; thus, using a static threshold degrades the performance of energy detection[7, 8]. A prior knowledge of the noise power or a reliable estimate of its level is thus necessary to enhance its detection performance. The autocorrelation-based sensing technique [9-12] computes the correlation function of the received N samples with the"
0,Spectrum Sensing: Enhanced Energy Detection Technique Based on Noise Measurement,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05118v1,Youness Arjoune,Arxiv,3,"time-shifted version of these N samples at lag zero and at lag one. If the value of this function is higher than a certain threshold, then the primary user signal is considered present; otherwise, it is considered absent.  Because the noise is uncorrelated, the autocorrelation-based sensing technique can distinguish between the signal and noise. The accuracy of this sensing technique depends on the number of samples and the threshold selection. The main drawback of this technique is that it requires a large number of samples to achieve a good performance, and thus, it increases the sensing time, which is not practical for cognitive radio systems that are expected to be rapid and efficient [8]. Matched filter detection [13, 14] is a technique that matches the received samples with some pre-collected and saved pilots of the same primary user signal stream. The received samples are convoluted with the saved pilots then averaged over N samples to compute the decision statistic, which is then compared to a threshold to obtain the sensing decision. If the result of this convolution is higher than a threshold, the primary user signal is considered present; otherwise, it is deemed to be absent. This technique provides better detection at low signal to noise ratio, and it is optimal in the sense that it needs only a few samples to achieve high detection probability in a short sensing time. However, matched filter detection requires the prior knowledge of some of the primary users signal characteristics. This knowledge is often unavailable, which makes this"

According to [5, 6, 9], The performance of these three sensing techniques depends on the number of samples and the sensing threshold. Taking more samples can enhance the detection performance of these techniques up to a certain value of SNR, after which further increase in the number of samples does not improve their detection performance. Increasing the number of samples can also increase the sensing time and in some cases, for instance, the wideband sensing, it is impractical to increase the number of sample when researcher are demanding to use compressive sensing to minimize the number of samples [15-16].  This detection performance can also be enhanced by using a dynamic threshold adapted to the level of noise present in the received signal. In this work, we consider energy detection to show that measuring the level of noise and using it to compute the sensing threshold can further enhance its detection performance. Last decades has seen several works investigating the improvement of the detection performance of energy detection using a dynamic selection of the threshold [17-22]. For instance, the authors of [17] have proposed a dynamic selection of the threshold using Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Bank method to minimize the spectrum sensing error in a noisy environment . This technique uses the Gradient-based updates to set a new value of the sensing threshold. The authors of [18] proposed an adaptive threshold detection algorithm based on an image binarization technique. This technique dynamically estimates the threshold based on previous iteration decision statistics and other"

In [19], the authors proposed an adaptive threshold that consists of two control parameters to adapt the requirements utilizing targeted probability of detection and false alarm. They determined the threshold based on two methods: Constant False Alarm Rate method which consists of fixing a target probability of false alarm and Constant Detection Rate method which sets the target probability of detection. Then, the threshold that Minimizes spectrum sensing error (MSSE) is selected. The authors of [20, 23] proposed a double-threshold algorithm that consists of using two thresholds "" and  # where 	""<#  instead of using a single-threshold. If the energy of the samples is smaller than "" then the spectrum is free and if the energy of samples is higher than # then the spectrum is occupied; otherwise, the secondary user is not sure about the presence or absence of the primary user. However, the authors did not explain how these two thresholds were selected. The authors of [22] addressed the process of the threshold selection by using Constant the False Alarm Rate method. This method consists of making a bound on the probability of false alarm and then maximizing the detection probability. The selection of this threshold is dynamically adapted to noise level present in the received signal. However, the authors did not explain how the noise was estimated, and they used directly the value of noise added to the signal generated in Matlab to"

All these previously mentioned papers proposed a dynamic selection of the threshold using different algorithms that take into consideration several parameters such as the noise present in the received signal and the target probability of false alarm. They validated their approaches using simulation. However, in a real-world scenario, several system parameters that are assumed constant in simulations may vary over time, which can result in the wrong sensing decision. Thus, the validation of the proposed models through only simulations using Matlab is not enough.  In this work, we investigate the use of dynamic threshold based on measuring the noise level present in the received signal to enhance the probability of detection and decrease the probability of false alarm. The approach measures the noise using a technique based on the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal. This technique calculates the eigenvalues, then, uses the Minimum Description Length criterion to split the eigenvalues corresponding to the signal and the ones corresponding to the noise [24- 27]. This technique is considered as blind estimation technique because the power of the signal and the power of the noise are unknown and these parameters are estimated from the received signal.  To set the structure of this paper, the rest of this paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the mathematical model of the proposed approach as well as the experimental setup using the GNU Radio software and USRP units. The third section gives and discusses the results. Finally, the"

II. METHODOLOGY A.  Mathematical Model  Spectrum sensing is one of the most important processes in the cycle of cognitive radio. It aims essentially to decide between two states: primary user signal is absent, denoted by	', or primary user signal is present, denoted by "". These two states can be modeled as follows:  ':	()=() (1)  "":	()=()+() (2) where () denotes the received signal, () denotes the transmitted signal, and () denotes the noise affecting the transmitted signal. In the following, we describe the concept of energy detection and the algorithm used for noise estimation. 1) Energy Detection As shown in the Fig. 1, energy detection computes the energy of the received N samples as the squared magnitude of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of these samples averaged over N samples [4-8], using the following formula:  =([])#89:"" (3) This energy  is then compared to a pre-defined threshold ; to obtain the sensing decision as follows: <	; : PU signal absent >	; : PU signal present The detection performance of the algorithm can be evaluated through the probability of detection ; and the probability of false alarm >?. The probability of detection refers to the numbers of correct detections (PU is present) over the total number of sensing trials while the probability of false alarm refers to the number of times that the PU is falsely detected over the total number of trials. These probabilities are given as:  @=Pr	(>;;"") (4) "

Fig.  1. Energy detection   According to [15], the probabilities of detection @ and false alarm HI are given by:  @=(KL8(MNOPMQO)(MNOPMQO)#8) (6)  HI=(KSL8MNOMNO#8) (7) Where Q-function ()=""#TexpYLZO#[	^_, a and b are the standard deviation of the noise and the PU signal, respectively, and N is the number of samples. In [19], the authors gives the formula of the detection-threshold ;, which is obtained from Eq. 7 and  given by:  ;=c#(L""(HI)2+)) (8) Where L""(.) is the inverse of the Q-function. This threshold depends on the noise variance, the number of samples, and the target probability of false alarm. Thus, a prior knowledge on the level of noise affecting the received signal is required to set an accurate threshold.  2) Noise Estimation  The noise is estimated based on the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal [24-27]. In the following, this technique is described. Consider the received signal,	, which can be expressed as a  matrix:  =h"","""",8m,""m,8n (9) Where o,p denotes the vector of the received signal samples.  The noise and the signals samples are assumed to be independent, and also the noise is assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance c#. Therefore, Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 can be rewritten as:  ':	o()=o() (10)  "":	o()=o()+o()           "

When	,, the statistical covariance matrices of the noise, of the transmitted samples, and of the received samples can be defined as:   Sc={()y()}=c#.m	;	<<+ (12)  S_={()y()} (13)  S}={()y()} (14) Where Sc denotes the noise statistical covariance matrix, S_ denotes the transmitted signal statistical covariance matrix, S}	denotes the statistical covariance matrix of the received signal, (.)y denotes complex conjugate transpose operator, c# denotes the noise variance, and m denotes the L-order identity matrix. Since the signal and the noise are independent, S} can be re-written as the sum of S_ and Sa:   S}=S_+Sc=S_+c#.m (15) Given the eigenvalues } of S} and  _ of Sb in a descending order, we obtain the following equations:  }o=}o+c#	,=1,2 (16)  }o=c#	,=+1,+2, (17) Where  denotes the group of eigenvalues and the statistical covariance matrix eigenvalues are equal to signal components power. The estimate of the received statistical covariance matrix S} can be computed instead of statistical covariance matrix as there exists a finite number of samples. The sample covariance matrix of the received signal is thus given by: "

The estimated value of K, denoted as , is given by:  =uY()(u)(u)+""#(2)[;01					(19) Where () and () are given by:  ()=omo:uP""    (20)  ()=""mLuomo:P"" (21) Where L is the number of eigenvalues, N is the number of samples and o is the set of eigenvalues.

B. Experimental Setup To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model in a real-world scenario, we have implemented this model using GNU radio software and USRP units. Fig. 2 presents the experimental setup consisting of one transmitter and one receiver. At the transmitter, we generated a signal of target SNR. This signal is transmitted using a USRP unit to another one. The two USRP units are connected through a radiofrequency cable to reduce the external noise. The received signal is used then to calculate the decision statistic, estimate the noise, and then get the sensing decision. The flow graph for the  signal generation was created using the blocks present in the GNU Radio software connected to the USRP transmitter by means of the 		 block. Gaussian noise was added to the signal source is varied by changing the standard deviation.   A second flow graph was created to get the samples from the USRP receiver and saved them in a Numpy array. The block 	 allows the GNU Radio software to obtain the samples from"

The FFT samples are squared and averaged over N samples to calculate the decision statistic	. The noise variance is measured from the received signal based on the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal	[], which is used to further compute the threshold ;, from Eq. 29. The decision statistic is then compared with the computed threshold to decide on the presence or the absence of the PU signal. If 	;then the PU signal is present and if 	; then the PU signal is absent. III. RESULTS Using the experimental setup specified in the previous section, several experiments were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model.  The performance of this technique with a dynamic threshold whose formula is given by Eq. 29 is evaluated and compared to that one of the energy detection with a static threshold using the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. The static threshold is given by:  b=(L""(HI)2+) (30) Where HI is the target probability of false alarm,	 is the number of samples, L"" is the inverse of Q-function, and  is the threshold factor. The probability of detection and the probability of false alarm are computed as:  P=				 (31)  P=					 (32) To evaluate the impact of the threshold on the performance of energy detection, we fixed the number of samples to N=128, the probability of false alarm to	10%, and the static threshold to 148. This threshold is varied by multiplying this static threshold by the factor, 1,"

For each value of SNR, we calculated the probability of detection. Fig. 3 shows the probability of detection as a function of SNR for the aforementioned values of threshold factor. From this figure, it can be seen that the probability of detection increases as SNR increases. It can also be seen that the highest probability of detection corresponds to a value of threshold factor equal to 1. As we increase the value  of the threshold factor, the probability of detection decreases. To evaluate the impact of dynamic threshold selection on the probability of detection, we fixed the number of samples to  Fig.  3.

For a value of probability of false alarm of 10% (Fig. 3) the probability of detection corresponding to the sensing technique with a dynamic threshold reaches 100% for a value of =2	 while the one corresponding to the sensing technique with a static threshold reaches 100% for =+1	. For probability of false alarm of 20% (Fig. 4), the probability of detection corresponding to the sensing technique with a dynamic threshold reaches the value of 100% for a value of =3	 while the one corresponding to the sensing technique with a static threshold reaches 100 % for a value of =0	. As a first conclusion, the dynamic selection of the sensing threshold based on the noise estimation improves the detection performance by increasing the probability of detection.

From these figures, it can be observed that the probability of detection increases at the probability of false alarm increases. Fig. 6 (=20	) shows that the probability of detection with the dynamic threshold reaches the value of 100% for a value of probability of false alarm 62% while that one corresponding to the sensing technique with a static threshold reaches the value of 100% for a probability of false alarm 100%. As we increase the value of SNR, the probability of detection of both techniques reaches 100%	faster. For instance, one can see from Fig. 9 (=2) that the probability of detection with dynamic threshold reaches 100% for a probability of false alarm of 10%  while the one with static threshold reaches 100% for a probability of 90%. It can also be seen that the dynamic selection of the threshold increases the probability of detection and decreases the probability of false alarm.

As a conclusion, the dynamic selection of the threshold increases the probability of detection and decreases the probability of false alarm. IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we described an enhanced energy detection based technique to increase the probability of detection and decrease the probability of false alarm using a dynamic threshold selection based on measuring the noise level present in the received signal. The level of noise is measured using a blind technique based on sample covariance matrix eigenvalues of the received signal. The proposed approach was implemented using the GNU Radio software and USRP units. The results show that the dynamic selection of the sensing threshold proposed in this work increases the probability of detection and decreases the probability of false alarm.

INTRODUCTION  Remote sensing imageries are acquired via imaging satellites, airplanes, etc. [1]. These devi ces are capable of monitoring various aspects of the earth's surface. Unlike natural images, which are captured using digital cameras and often contain a limited number of objects, remote sensing imageries can encompass vast geographical areas and hold num erous contents with varying dimensions and sizes. Remote sensing images, in contrast to ground images, are not object -centric. Therefore, they can be used for various applications, including land cover classification, road network extraction, disaster prev ention, and monitoring [2, 3]. Only artificial intelligence and machine learning systems can process this volume of data. Fortunately, recent advances in computer vision have made it easier to process and analyze visual data points [4]. With the recent adva ncements in deep learning for computer vision applications, the supervised learning approaches for land cover classification in remote sensing images have performed exceptionally well. However, the main drawback of supervised learning is that it needs a tr emendous amount of labeled samples. Providing this volume of remote -sensing images is very costly and time -consuming.

While this transfer learning has produced acceptable results for remote sensing tasks, It has the following drawbacks:  1. If there are significant domain differences  between the remote sensing and the ImageNet datasets, this type of transfer learning will fail. As a result, it can perform poorly in some cases, such as hyperspectral and multispectral images.  2. Transferring ImageNet pre -trained weights directly to non-RGB remote sensing datasets is impossible [3, 14 -19].  Domain differences between the natural and remote sensing images stimulate researchers to find alternative solutions.  To do so, some researchers used supervised or unsupervised methods  to pre-trained  models on remote sensing datasets. The learned weights are then transferred to other remote -sensing tasks[5, 19]. However, the disadvantage of the supervised pre -training is that it requires large in -domain labeled samples to learn general representations from remote sensing images.  Self-supervised learning has emerged to overcome all of the previously mentioned drawbacks. It aims to learn effective representations of the input data without relying on human -provided labels . Recent advances in se lf-supervised learning have demonstrated that their pre -trained features have a higher transferability than ImageNet models. This branch of artificial intelligence is advantageous when acquiring labeled data is time -consuming and expensive, such as medical  and satellite images[14].

Recently, contrastive self -supervised lea rning [20] outperformed  other  feature learning methods. These methods  significantly narrowed  the gap between  supervised  and unsupervised approaches in representation learning  [21]. Currently, the most effective contrastive self -supervised algorithms[22] em ploy data augmentation techniques to generate positive samples. In other words, they use data augmentation techniques such as image cropping, rotation, and so on to create multiple views of the same image. The objective function tries to bring positive sam ples as close to each other as possible in the feature space. In most of these methods, positive and negative pairs compete with each other [23].  Since these methods do not require labeled data, we can use a large amount of unlabeled data  to learn the feat ures in an unsupervised way and then transfer the weights to other remote sensing tasks.   Selecting an appropriate dataset for visual representation learning from remote sensing images, either supervised or self-supervised, is one of the influencing factor s in learning high-generalizable features, which have huge effects on the performance of the final model on downstream tasks. In recent works, such as [6] and [17], researchers have determined the influencing factors on the datasets for pre -training featur es in a supervised manner from satellite images.

A brief overview of self -supervised learning methods    3     Self-supervised learning is a highly practical subset of unsupervised learning that aims to learn general visual features from images without the use o f human labels.  In general, self -supervised learning methods consist of two steps. In the first step, a pretext task is designed , and by solving this proxy task, visual representations are learned. The second step is to transfer the  pre-trained  features from the previous step to other downstream tasks. The resulting model from the first step can be used as a starting point for further fine -tuning or feature extraction. Such techniques  will be advantageous  for difficult -to-label aerial and medical  images .  In the following section, we have classified the self -supervised visual representation learning methods into three groups and discussed each one.

The author s have classified all pretext tasks into four categories:  1. Generative -based methods such as image -colorization, super -resolution, etc  2. Context -based tasks, such as image jigsaw puzzles, geometric transformations, etc.  3. Free semantic label -based tasks, such as  contour detection, depth estimation, etc.  4. Cross Modal -based methods such as optical flow estimation, visual -audio correspondence, etc.    Moreover, t he researchers in [31] and [32] combined several pretext tasks  for capturing high generalizable features . These studies demonstrated that different pretext tasks are complementary and that combining them results in the acquisition of more generalizable features.  The visual representations learned by solving most of t he pretext tasks have limited generalizability and performance  on downstream tasks  compared to the ImageNet pre-trained models .   Clustering:    Clustering -based methods are another type of unsupervised method for learning visual representations. They alternate between clustering the representations and learning to predict  the cluster  assignment.  Instead of directly comparing features as in contrastive learning,  SwAV[21] clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image.

Despite the fact that clustering -based methods have been very effective for learning visual representations, due to the need to alternate between clusterin g and feature learning, they require high computing resources.   Contrastive self -supervised learning :   The most contrastive self -supervised learning methods have emerged In  the last two years. These methods minimized the gap between supervised and unsupervised feature learning. We refer readers to [35] and [36] to learn more about contrastive self -supervised learning algorithms.  The main idea of contrastive learn ing is to bring pairs of positive samples closer together and pairs of negative samples further apart in the feature space.  In practice, the performance of contrastive learning methods is highly dependent on a large number of negative samples [35]. As a result, a large number of negative samples must be provided. For instance, the PIRL [37] algorithm stores negative sample s in a memory bank, while the MoCo [38] algorithm stores a row of negative samples in a momentum encoder. In contrast, the SimCLR [22] algorit hm generates negative examples with large batch sizes, necessitating the use of significant computational resources. Unlike other contrastive self -supervised learning methods, the SimSiam algorithm does not need a memory bank or a larger batch size. Theref ore, it requires fewer computation resources.  2.3.

In another work, a pretext task is defined in a way that predicts RGB  channel s information using  high-frequency  channel s informatio n[18]. Additionally, [15] employs image colorization, relative position prediction, and instance discr imination  as pretext tasks for learning the in -domain representations from  remote sensing images. The learned  features  are evaluated by transferring to other land cover classification datasets with very few labeled samples. In [39] the MoCov2 algorithm have been modified by introducing a geography -aware cost function  to learn the visual features of remote sensing image s.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SIMSIAM ALGORITHM  The method we used in this paper  is divided into two sections:  1. Self -supervised pre -training using the SimSiam algorithm.  2. Transfer ring the  pre-trained weights in the previous step to downstream tasks and eva luating the generalizability of features  by fine -tuning on various land cover classification datasets .   The features learned using most contrastive learning algorithms are highly generalizable. However, the main drawback of these methods is their high computational requirements. In general, this requirement for plenty of computational resources is motivated by the following three main items: 1. negative samples; 2. large batch size; 3. momentum encoder.  Unlike other contrastive learning methods, the SimSiam algorithm does not require any of the three items mentioned above, making it significantly more computational resource -efficient. There fore, we employ this algorithm to learn the visual features of remote sensing images [24]. The schematic of this algorithm is shown in Figure 1 :   Figure 1 :  SimSiam architecture    After applying different data augmentation techniques to the image x, two distinct views, 1 and 2, are generated. Both of these two distinct perspectives are entered into both sides of the Siamese architecture and then processed using the encoder f. Th is encoder utilizes a ResNet50 backbone, and an MLP projection head to extract the features from the input image. Therefore, each image is converted from pixel space to a"

The projection head in the encoder f consists of three layers of MLP with batch normalization layers applied to each fully connected layer, including the output layer.  Following the encoder(f), the architecture only has a top -side prediction head module. The prediction head MLP(h) merges the encoder outputs for the 1 view and then matches its dimensions to the encoder output on the bottom side of the architecture. This MLP (h) is composed of two fully connected layers and a hidden layer that has been subjected to a batch normalization layer. The trained weights are shared on both sides of the model. [28] demonstrated that copying weights on both sides of Siamese architectures produces poor results. They have provided a momentum update to avoid this issue. The proposed solution has the disadvantage of requiring a larg e number of computational resources. The SimSiam employs a stop -gradient operator on one side of the architecture to overcome the requirement for high computational resources as the BYOL [23] algorithm does. When the stop -gradient operator is applied to any side of the network, the gradients on that side are not updated  via backpropagation. The proposed cost function is simple and is defined as a function of the cosine similarity of two vectors. If we illustrate the output vectors of two views with p1 h(f(x1)) and z2 f(x2), where h(f(x1)) represents the output of the prediction head applied to f(x1) and f(.) is the backbone which is applied to both views , then the"

Finally, the total cost function is a symmetric function, which is defined as follows:  L=12 (p1,z2)+12 (p2,z1) ,p2 h(f(x2)) The cost obtained for all images in the batch is averaged and considered as the total loss. The stop gradient operator is a critical component that makes this algorithm work well. This operator applies to the features extracted from each view; therefore, the final cost function is defined as follows:  =12 (1, (2))+12 (2, (1)) This relationship demonstrates t hat the defined cost function is perfectly symmetric. Additionally, gradients are updated only when a corresponding view enters the network from the top side of the architecture [24].   4.

Although Resisc45 has higher class diversity and more similarity to the target datasets,  the pre -trained features on the PatternNet have a higher generalization ability on all downstream tasks. A vital factor that comes into view is the spatial resolution of source datasets. It is between 0.06m and 4.96m for PatternNet , 0.1m to 10m for MLRSNet,  and 0.2m and 30m for Resisc45. Therefore, the spatial resolution of PatternNet is higher than Resisc45  and MLRSNet . The high spatial resolution in remote sensing images makes the edges of the objects in the images sharper, and because self -supervised lear ning methods provide supervisory signals from the data, the presence of these edges makes the differences between the objects in the images more accentuated . As a result, the SimSiam model can better learn the difference between the objects in the dataset.  It is conclusive that the importance of other factors such as class similarity, class diversity, and the number of samples for learning general features from remote sensing images using the SimSiam are highlighted when the pre -training dataset has a high spatial"

MLRSNet is much larger than PatternNet, but the generalizability of PatternNet is better than that of MLRSNet. It means that; although the class diversity, class similarity, and number of samples of the PatternNet dataset to the target datasets are lower than Resisc45 and MLRSNet, these factors are still significant for the PatternNet dataset. All these factors make PatternNet an appropriate source for pre -training visual features using the SimSiam algorithm.

These results indi cate that when using the SimSiam algorithm to train visual representations from remote sensing images, the choice of higher -resolution datasets is a critical factor with a huge impact on the final performance of downstream tasks. However, the conclusions a re made based only on three datasets, and additional experiments with diverse datasets are required to make more precise generalizations.   B. Linear Evaluation with limited number of samples  In this section, by using linear evaluation, we further examined the quality of the pre -trained features. In the figure below, we have shown the general outline of the linear evaluation.    Figure 1: Chematic of a linear evaluator. Pre -trained model serves as feature extractor.    For linear evaluation of pre -trained features, we freeze the backbone of the ResNet50 model and only train the head, which is the classifier.  Therefore, the backbone of the model serves as the feature extractor.  Since fine -tuning the whole model distorts all t he pre -trained weights, we believe it can not provide an ideal solution for the evaluation of different pre-trained models.  In contrast, fine -tuning the last layer does not change the pre -trained weights. Therefore, it better shows the capability of the pr e-trained backbone in extracting general features from remote sensing images.

CONCLUSIONS  Recently, contrastive learning, a subset of self -supervised learning, has made significant progress in general visual representations of natural images. The available remote -sensing datasets have different numbers of samples and channels, spatial resolutio ns, and image sizes. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the transferability of self -supervised pre -trained features from remote sensing images and determine the right factors that make the dataset a good choice for feature pre -training. In this paper, w e utilized the SimSiam for in -domain general feature learning from three remote -sensing datasets with different characteristics. The pre -trained weights were then evaluated by fine -tuning and linear evaluation on other land cover classification datasets ac hieving state -of-the-art results. Our deliberate experiments demonstrate that for contrastive self -supervised pre -training of remote -sensing images, higher resolution datasets lead to better performance on downstream tasks.

IntroductionThe impact of video super-resolution (VSR) in our dailylife has become more prominent in the recent years as highquality contents can be delivered while its lower qualitycounterpart is rendered or stored, saving either computa-tional or storage resources. The application of deep neu-ral networks to the task of rendering high-resolution framesusing its low-resolution sampled counterpart has broughtforward substantial improvements that enables technologieslike Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) [11] and Deep-Fovea [24, 51]. They deliver high quality content on acomputationally-constrained platform. While existing VSRtechniques are implemented on a pixel level and are able toreconstruct video content to a point that is visually pleasing,certain context that are of high-quality that is meant to bedelivered might not be fully reconstructed, restricting highfrequency context from being delivered, e.g. texts and finetextures. Results of VSR techniques are visually acceptableup to 4VSR, while frames generated using 8VSR havedistinctive flaws that affects the overall viewing experience.We argue that VSR methods while being useful for deliv-ering general contexts, it should open up the possibility offusing super-resolved frames with regional high-resolution(HR) context(s), e.g. HR patches, that are crucial for theunderstanding of the gist of the delivered content.With the increase in adoption of augmented and virtualreality (AR/VR) devices [12, 49, 17], the demand for high-resolution content will show similar spike. As more pixelsare required for the immersive experience for AR/VR, de-velopers are searching for effective ways to reduce the com-putational cost of"

A feasibleapproach is to include an eye tracker in the AR/VR head-set to estimate the gaze direction of the user [7]. Frames arerendered based on the gaze direction of the user [40, 24], re-sulting in huge reduction in computational cost. Our workleverages the eye tracker of such devices for the task ofFoveated Video Super-Resolution (FVSR). FVSR is usefulif we are to transfer HR content to be viewed in real-time,especially to AR/VR devices. Transferring the HR framesat its full resolution might not be feasible at a bandwith-constrained environment. For FVSR, only the pixels thatfall in gaze region are transmitted in HR while the rest aretransmitted in low-resolution (LR). This results in huge sav-arXiv:2212.13525v1  [cs.CV]  27 Dec 2022ings in bandwidth as it is empirically shown that the humaneye is only able to perceive and resolve around 1% of pix-els in a frame [46, 15]. The main challenge of FVSR is thetransfer of context from the HR to the LR region, to preventabrupt transition in visual quality.As prior works of VSR dont consider the fusion of LRand HR context, cross-temporal operation or alignment isperformed on the feature maps of lowest spatial resolution,i.e. during the propagation and aggregation stages [4, 5].The temporally-aggregated low spatial resolution featuremaps are then upsampled using a sequence of upsamplingfilters to reconstruct the HR frame. To incorporate regionalHR context(s) into the super-resolution pipeline, we need tohave precise spatial locality for the placement of the HR re-gion. To do so, we propose a Cross-Resolution Flow Propa-gation (CRFP) framework that follow existing"

To aggregate the foveatedcontext into the super-resolution pipeline, few modifica-tions are made. Foveated region are fed to the Feature Ag-gregator (FA) using a feedback mechanism. Multiple FAsare placed at the features of lowest resolution and a singleFA is placed before an output block with features having thetargeted resolution. As the spatial resolution of the featuremaps of the final stage (after upsampling stages) matchesthe spatial resolution of the HR region, i.e. matching coor-dinates, the spatial fusion of both features can be precise.Leveraging VSR techniques for the construction of CRFP,we show promising results for FVSR that are not achievableby existing VSR techniques.The closest work to our proposed research direction ofFVSR is DeepFovea [24]. DeepFovea performs video in-painting given a sequence of sparse frames. As FVSR is anovel task, the only comparison we make is with the archi-tecture we bootstrap CRFP on, BasicVSR++ [5] (SoTA inVSR), modified for the task of FVSR. Our contributions aresummarized as follows:1. We propose a new task of Foveated Video Super-Resolution (FVSR). FVSR requires an eye tracker towork and is applicable to the growing adoption ofAR/VR devices for the streaming of HR video.2. We propose a Cross-Resolution Flow Propagation(CRFP) technique for FVSR, demonstrating convinc-ing results for FVSR.3. To quantitatively measure the performance of FVSR,we propose the evaluation of Past Foveated Region us-ing PSNR and SSIM to better evaluate the capabilityof a model to retain contexts from previous frames.2.

Curcio et al. [8] showsthat theres a rapid decrease in the number of photoreceptorsin the eye from the fovea to the periphery, also known as ec-centricity. Despite the loss in spatial resolution, Rovamo etal. [37] shows that temporal sensitivity remains static spa-tially, requiring the displayed video to have smooth transi-tion across frames. The perception of spatial detail at a cer-tain spatial frequency (visual acuity) is limited by the den-sity of the midget ganglion cells that provide the pathwayout of the eye [26, 36]. Dacey and Patersen [9] show thattheres an order of 30reduction in cell density from thefovea to periphery (0- 40), giving us a hint on the size ofthe foveated region to be cropped from the HR image. Thecentral 5.2region of the retina has high sensitivity, cover-ing only 0.8% of total pixels on a regular display [46, 15].This finding points us to the choice of cropping 1% of thetotal pixels as the foveated region in our experiments.Studies in [44, 48] shows that in peripheral regions, mis-match between optical, retinal and final neural samplingresolutions leads to aliasing in our peripheral vision.

Simulating FVSR with Eye Tracker NoiseWe show similar a simulation as the one shown in themain paper in Figure 7.D. Analysis of CRFP-FastFor CRFP to achieve real-time latency for head-mounteddevice, only a fixed region ( 720720) is passed through theDCN blocks within the feature aggregator for fine-grainedwarping while the rest are forward propagated through theresidual block within the feature aggregator. Using this ap-proach, we are able to reduce the latency by a factor of 3(latency of 14 ms per frame using RTX 3090), enabling real-time inference using our architecture. Although CRFP-Fasthas low VMAF score in the main paper, it is shown to be vi-sually pleasing in Figure 8. As pixel region far beyond thefoveal acuity are not efficiently picked up by our visual sys-tem, loss in visual quality in that region doesnt not affectour visual perception of the video.E.

Energy-harvestingsystems operate intermittently, only when energy is avail-able from the environment. To operate, a device graduallybuffers energy into a storage element (capacitor). Oncesufcient energy is accumulated, the device begins oper-ations. However, energy depletes more rapidly (e.g. mil-liseconds) during an operation compared to energy accu-mulation/charging (e.g. seconds). Further, energy accumu-lation in RF energy harvesting is sacriced in backscattercommunication links since a portion of the incident energyis reected back during communications.

Ranasinghe",Arxiv,5,"in millisecond time scales [7], [18],[19] as experimentally validated in Fig. 2.Timing of power loss events across devices are ad-hoc. For example, harvested energy varies under differingdistances; therefore, a computation task may only executepartially before power failure and it is hard to predict whenit will occur.Further, saving and subsequently retrieving state at codeexecution checkpoints for a long-run application via anintermittent execution model [20] is not only: i) costly interms of computations and energy [21]saving state in non-volatile memories such as Flash or Electrically Erasable Pro-grammable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) consumes moreenergy than static RAM (SRAM) whilst reading state fromFerroelectric Random Access Memory (FRAM) consumesmore energy than writing as we demonstrate in Fig. 5; butalso: ii) renders a device in a vulnerable state for an attackerto exploit when checkpoint state is stored on an off-chipmemory, due to the lack of internal MCU memory, wherenon-invasive contact probes can be used to readout contentswhen the memory bus used is easily accessible [22]. Forexample, common memory readout ports such as the I2C(Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus used by a microcontroller forconnecting to external memory devices are often exposedon the top layer of a printed circuit board (PCB). Hence,the content stored in an off-chip NVM can be easily readout using contact probes without any damage to the hard-ware [23].These issues make the execution of long-run securityalgorithms, such as Elliptic Curve Dife-Hellman (ECDH)1key exchange, difcult to deploy securely.Consequently, power must be carefully managed toavoid power loss and leaving the device in a potentiallyvulnerable state; and, we must seek computationally ef-cient security schemes.Unavailability of hardware security"

More precisely, a token specic MACtags0i MAC ki(rmwarejjverijjnver )is computed byeach tokenTi. If the received MAC tag simatches the devicecomputed s0i, the integrity of the rmware established andthe issuing Server is authenticated by the token. Subse-quently, the new rmware is updated and the new versionnumber nver is stored as veri. Otherwise, the rmware isdiscarded and the session is aborted. Notably, the EPC Gen2protocol provides a reliable transfer feature. Each broadcastpayload is protected by a 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC-16) error detection method. Hence, the noticationof a CRC failure to the Server results in the automatic re-transmission of the packet by the Server. Therefore, a MACtag mismatch is more likely to be adversarial and discardingthe rmware is a prudent action.

Considering the highly resourcelimited tokens, we propose a lightweight challenge responsebased mechanism re-using the MAC() function developedforWisecr . The server sends a randomly generated challengec RNG()and evaluates the corresponding response r0tovalidate the installation. We provision a new session key skto enable the remote attestation to proceed independent ofthe previous stages, whilst avoiding the derivation of a keyon device to reduce the overhead of the attestation routine.We propose two modes of attestation; a fast mode andanelaborate mode to trade-off veracity of the vericationagainst computational and power costs. The fastmode onlyexamines the token serial number ( idi) and the versionnumber ( veri). While the elaborate mode traverses over anentire memory segment. The elaborate mode is relativelymore time consuming but allows the direct verication ofthe code installed on the target token Ti.We illustrate (in Fig. 4) and demonstrate (in Sec-tion 4.5) the elaborate mode (more veracious and com-putationally intensive) where response r0 MAC sk(ckselected segment (rmware )kidikveri)attests theapplication memory segment containing the installedrmware .

We opt for achiev-ing secure storage and bootloader immutability using Run-time Access Protection by exploiting the MCUs memory7protection unit (MPU), which offers exibility to the boot-loader. In particular, the MPU allows r ead/w rite/ex ecutepermissions to be dened individually for memory seg-ments at power-upprior to any rmware (application)code execution. Wisecr requires the following segment per-missions to be dened by the bootloader to prevent theirsubsequent modications through application code by lock-ing the MPU:SegmentMis used as the secure storage area. Duringapplication execution, any access (reading/writing) tothis segment results in an access violation, causing thedevice to restart in the bootloader.SegmentMrxcontains the bootloader, device interrupt vec-tor table (IVT), shared code (e.g., EPC Gen2 implemen-tation).

We detail our solution below.3.2.1 Managing Application Layer InterruptionsThe bootloader must be uninterruptible (by applicationcode) for security considerations. For instance, the ap-plication codedue to an unintentional software bug orotherwisecould interrupt the bootloader while the devicekey is in a CPU register, so that the application code (ex-ploited by an attacker) can copy the device key to a locationunder its control, or completely subvert access protectionsby overriding the MPU register before it is locked.Recall, the memory segment Mrx(see Section 3.1) in-cludes the memory region containing the IVT. This ensuresthat only the bootloader can modify the IVT. Since the IVT isunder the bootloaders control, we can ensure that any non-maskable interrupt is unable to be directly congured by theapplication code, whereas all other interrupts are disabledduring bootloader execution. Consequently, the interruptconguration cannot be mutated by application code.3.2.2 Managing Power-Loss InterruptionsFrequent and inevitable power loss during the bootloaderexecution will not only interrupt the execution, degradingcode dissemination performance but also compromise se-curity.

We repeated the code dissemination process 100times at each distance test, for each of the 7 different pilotselection methods. We recorded two measures: i) latency(seconds); and ii) number of times the broadcast attempt up-dated all of the 4 in-eld devices.As illustrated in Fig. 8.(b),at 40 cm where the power conditions are more critical at atoken, the selected pilot token with the lowest token voltage(Vt) shows an enormous advantage, in terms of both la-tency and attempt number. Overall, our proposed approach(electing the lowest Vt) ensures that most observer tokensare able to correctly obtain and validate the rmware in agiven broadcast session on the rst attempt in the criticalpowering regions of operation (we provide a theoreticaljustication in Appendix D).We also evaluated the reduction in power consumptionachieved from computational tasks, in addition to elimi-nating the communication task.

Notably, Wisecr and SecuCode outperforms theWisecr (Seq). Because, Wisecr (Seq) incurs a larger overheadthrough the need for executing a Security Association stageto setup the broadcast security parameters, for each device.Further, SecuCode (without IP protection) does not needto execute the power intensive rmware decryption oper-ations, and thus is less likely to encounter power-loss andupdate session failure or require the extra time necessarybyWisecr to decrpyt the rmware. As expected, Wisecroutperforms albeit the added security functions providedin comparison to SecuCode.Second, following the method and metrics in Stork [7],we tested the performance of the schemes by increasing thenumber of CRFID devices to be updated. We can see inFig. 12(b) that the latency of both Wisecr (Seq) and SecuCodeincreases linearly while Wisecr remains relatively steadyregardless of the number of devices to update.

Notably, the topic of wirelesscode updating has been intensively studied for battery pow-ered Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes. For example,a recent study by Florian et al. [29] proposed updatingthe rmware and peer-to-peer attestation of multiple meshnetworked IoT devices. Physical unclonable functions [17]and blockchains [48] have also been utilized in code dis-seminationBut, such schemes [29], [48] are designed for batterypowered WSN nodes featuring device-to-device communicationcapability , and supervisory control of operating systems (e.gTinyOS), absent in batteryless CRFID devices (see challengesin Section 1). Further, batteryless devices operate underextreme energy and computational capability limitations. Inparticular, harvested energy is intermittent and limited andthus devices face difculties supporting security functionssuch as key exchange using Elliptic Curve Dife-Hellmanused in [29]. Therefore, we focus on research into wirelessdissemination schemes for CRFID like devices in our discus-sions.

Although the Wisecr reasonably assumes (asinR3[21] and Stork [7]) that the devices are at relativelyconstant distances from an RFID reader antenna during theshort duration rmware update process (approximately 16 sin the application demonstration), occasionally this assump-tion may not hold. For example, when re-programmingdevices on a conveyor belt, it is desirable to not delay themovement of the tags and to re-program whilst distances arechanging. Development of a solution to the problem in thecontext of resource limited devices operating over a highlyconstrained air interface protocol is a challenging problemand an interesting direction for future work.Additionally, every BlockWrite command used tobroadcast the rmware contains a CRC-16 eld for errordetection [35]. In our Pilot-Observer mode, only the pilot-detected CRC errors are indicated to the Host; future workcould consider the problem of broadcast reliability further.Notably, developing a method is non-trivial given the limi-tations of the EPC Gen2 air interface protocol.In our secure update method, the pilot token and observertokens do not explicitly synchronize progress due to theconstrained air interface protocol not supporting token-to-token communications as well as the extremely limitedavailable power. This also makes it difcult for the serverto immediately, i.e. during the Secure Broadcast stage, todetect an observer token that has de-synchronized. Anysynchronization would need to involve the Host performingthis function, such as reading back of memory contentsfrom a tokens download region and re-transmitting missingpackets, at set intervals"

Hence, developing an explicitsynchronization method in the context of a secure broadcastmethod forms an interesting direction for future work.Further, it will be interesting to consider alternativemechanisms for validating the installation of rmware, suchas the exploitation of the reply signal to the nal packetdelivering rmware to tokens. We leave this interestingdirection to explore for future work.REFERENCES[1] B. Lucia, V . Balaji, A. Colin, K. Maeng, and E.

It is theoretically possible to compute and include aMAC tag in an acknowledgment message at the end of theValidation stage but the implementation of this in practice21is not possible. Our current acknowledgment signal is basedon exploiting the last message in a singulation sessionseeRFID singulation phase in the Validation stage in Fig. 16.This last message returns the the unique device identieror EPC (electronic product code). We piggy back the currentversion number veriin the data eld part of this message asoursoftvalidation signal. This is possible because at power-up (whether it be software or hardware reset) the deviceexecutes the bootloader and during its execution copies theidiandverito a global SRAM memory region for useafter the MPU (memory protection unit) prevents access tothis content stored in the secure storage area (see memoryprotection unit segmentation diagram in Fig. 10.Notably, even if a MAC tag was computed by thebootloader after power cycling (reboot) in the Validationstage, and stored in global memory for access after MPUprotections to be used during the singulation phase thatfollows, the data eld in the last EPC message is limitedto 96 bits. Thus, there is inadequate room to piggyback a128-bit MAC tag. Further, this would be an added overheadsince the MAC computation would need to occur each timea CRFID device is powered (booted), irrespective of whetherthe MAC is needed or not.Thus, it is better to compute a MAC tag after reboot,on demand and when necessary by: i) singulating a tokenrst; ii) instructing the token to compute the MAC tag; andiii)"

Dewdropexplores a dynamic on-device task scheduling method,however, requires the overhead of collecting samples ofthe harvester voltage and task scheduling by the devicesapplication code.In addition, Dewdrop is only suitable for CRFID devicesequipped with a passive charge pump, such as WISP4.1 [2]since Dewdrop requires directly measuring the chargingrate of the reservoir capacitorcharge storage element. Inthe follow-up, WISP version 5.1, the passive charge pump isreplaced with a S-882z active charge pump and the reservoircapacitor is only connected to the load when Vcapdevelopedacross the capacitor exceeds the reference voltage of 2.4 V(Vref).

So it is difcultto employ our previous method to predict clock cycles bymonitoring GPIO pins.To overcome the above challenge, we used debuggertools to read the CRFID devices internal states by insertingthree breakpoints: Breakpoint 1: before the receiving routineis called; Breakpoint 2: in between the receiving routine andthe reply routine; Breakpoint 3: after the reply routine (asillustrated in Fig. 19). Clock cycles for receiving and replyingcan be acquired by looking at the clock prole counter ateach breakpoint.TheSecureComm command in the EPC Gen2 speci-cation is yet to be widely supported in commercial RFIDhardware.

Ackley estimates that 85% of the patients were suffering from gun shot wounds.[2] Col. Chamberlin spent many hours interviewing patients as to their reactions to bullet wounds. He also conducted many live animal experiments after his tour of duty. On the subject of wound ballistics theories, he wrote:If I had to pick one of these theories as gospel, Id still go along with the Hydraulic Reaction of the Body Fluids plus the reactions on the Central Nervous System.[1]Other World War II era scientists noted remote pressure wave effects in the peripheral nerves.[3][4] There was support for the idea of remote neural effects of ballistic pressure waves in the medical and scientific communities, but the term ""hydrostatic shock"" and similar phrases including shock were used mainly by 2gunwriters (such as Jack O'Conner[5]) and the small arms industry (such as Roy Weatherby.[6])A Myth?Dr. Martin Fackler, a Vietnam-era trauma surgeon and ballistics researcher, claimed that hydrostatic shock had been disproven.  Specifically, he said the assertion that a pressure wave plays a role in injury or incapacitation"
0,Scientific Evidence for Hydrostatic Shock,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3051v1,"Michael Courtney, Amy Courtney",Arxiv,3,"is a myth.[7]  Others, including ballistics experts with the FBI, expressed similar views.[8][9]  In support of his claim, Dr. Fackler argued that a lithotriptor (a medical device used to break up kidney stones with sonic pressure waves) produces no damage to soft tissues.  Since a lithotriptor produces pressure waves larger than those caused by most handgun bullets, he concluded that ballistic pressure waves cannot damage tissue either.[11]  However, Facklers claim by analogy has been disproven.  Tissue damage due to lithotriptors has been widely documented.[12][13][14]Other than analogies to lithotriptors and a 1947 study which did not examine neural tissue,[10] authors arguing against ballistic effects remote from the wound channel have not provided experimental evidence.  Because subtle damage in neural tissues was difficult to detect, denials persisted for some time.  However, as discussed below, scientific progress eventually afforded considerable support for it.Parallels with Blast (Explosions)A shock wave can be created when fluid is rapidly displaced by an explosive or projectile. Duncan MacPherson, a member of the defunct International Wound Ballistics Association and author of the book, Bullet Penetration, claimed that shock waves cannot result from bullet impacts with tissue.[9] In contrast, Brad Sturtevant, a leading researcher in shock wave physics at Caltech for many decades, found that shock waves canresult from handgun bullet impacts in tissue.[15] Other sources also indicate that ballistic impacts can create shock waves in tissue.[16][17][18]Blast and ballistic pressure waves have physical similarities.  They also have similarities in how they cause neural effects in the brain. In"
0,Scientific Evidence for Hydrostatic Shock,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3051v1,"Michael Courtney, Amy Courtney",Arxiv,4,"tissue, both types of pressure waves have similar magnitudes, duration, and frequency characteristics. Both have been shown to cause damage in the area of the brain known as the hippocampus.[19][20][21] It has been hypothesized that both can reach the brain from the thoracic cavity via major blood vessels.For example, Ibolja Cernak, a leading researcher in blast wave injury at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, hypothesized, ""alterations in brain function following blast exposure are induced by kinetic energy transfer of blast overpressure via great blood vessels in abdomen and thorax to the central nervous system.""[22]This hypothesis is supported by observations of neural effects in the brain from localized blast exposure focused on the lungs in animal experiments.[20]Hydrostatic shock expresses the idea that organs can be damaged by the pressure wave independently from direct contact with the penetrating projectile. If one interprets the ""shock"" in ""hydrostatic shock"" to refer to physiological effects rather than physical wave characteristics, the question of whether the pressure waves satisfy the definition of shock wave is unimportant.  There is compelling scientific evidence supporting the ability of a ballistic pressure wave to create tissue damage and incapacitation in living targets.3Physics of Ballistic Pressure WavesA number of investigators have studied the physics of ballistic pressure waves created when a ballistic projectile enters a viscous medium.[23][24][25] Ballistic impacts produce pressure waves that propagate near the speed of sound.Lee et al. present an analytical model showing that unreflected ballistic pressure waves are well approximated by an exponential decay, which is similar to blast"
0,Scientific Evidence for Hydrostatic Shock,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3051v1,"Michael Courtney, Amy Courtney",Arxiv,5,"pressure waves.[23] Lee et al. also note the importance of energy transfer, writing, an accurate estimation of the kinetic energy loss by a projectile is always important in determining the ballistic waves.The rigorous methods of Lee et al. require knowing the drag coefficient and frontal area of the penetrating projectile at every instant of the penetration. Since this is not generally possible with expanding handgun bullets, a model for estimating the peak pressure waves of handgun bullets from the impact energy and penetration depth in ballistic gelatin has been developed.[26] This model agrees with the more rigorous approach of Lee et al. in cases where they can both be applied. For expanding handgun bullets, the peak pressure wave magnitude is proportional to the bullets kinetic energy divided by the penetration depth.Remote Cerebral Effects of Ballistic Pressure WavesA Swedish research group (Goransson et al.) were the first contemporary researchers to present compelling evidence for remote cerebral effects from bullet impact to an extremity.[27]They observed significantly reduced electrical activity in the brain via EEG readings from pigs shot in the thigh. Investigating further, another research group (Suneson et al.) implanted high-speed pressure transducers into the brain of pigs and demonstrated that a significant pressure wave reaches the brain of pigs shot in the thigh.[18][28]These scientists observed breathing disruption, depressed EEG readings, and neural damage in the brain caused by the distant effects of the ballistic pressure wave originating in the thigh.These results were later  confirmed and expanded upon by a Chinese research group (Wang et al.) conducting"

A high-frequency oscillating pressure wave with large amplitude and short duration was found in the brain. . .  They observed significant damage in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus regions of the brain due to remote effects of the ballistic pressure wave.Remote Pressure Wave Effects in the Spine and Internal OrgansThe brain is not the only organ subject to remote pressure wave effects.  In a study of handgun injury, Sturtevant found that pressure waves from a bullet impact in the torso can reach the spine.  Moreover, a focusing effect from concave surfaces can concentrate the pressure wave on the spinal cord, producing significant injury.[15]  This is consistent with other work showing remote spinal cord injuries from ballistic impacts.[38][39]A group at Johns Hopkins University (Roberts et al.) has published both experimental work and finite element modeling showing considerable pressure wave magnitudes in the thoracic cavity produced by handgun projectiles stopped by a Kevlar vest.[16][17] For example, an 8 gram projectile at 360 m/s impacting a NIJ level II vest over the sternum can produce an estimated pressure wave level of nearly 2.0 MPa (300 PSI) in the heart and of nearly 1.5 MPa (220 PSI) in 4the lungs. Impacting over the liver can  produce an estimated pressure wave level of 2.0 MPa (300 PSI) in the liver.Energy Transfer Required for Remote Neural EffectsOur own research (Courtney and Courtney) supports the conclusion"
0,Scientific Evidence for Hydrostatic Shock,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3051v1,"Michael Courtney, Amy Courtney",Arxiv,7,"that handgun levels of energy transfer can produce pressure waves leading to incapacitation and injury.[29][30][26][31][32]The work of Suneson et al. also suggests that remote neural effects can occur with levels of energy transfer possible with handguns (roughly 500 ft-lbs/700 joules). Using sensitive biochemical techniques, the work of Wang et al. suggests even lower impact energy thresholds for remote neural injury to the brain. In analysis of experiments of dogs shot in the thigh they report highly significant neural effects in the hypothalamus and hippocampus (regions of the brain) with energy transfer levels close to 150 ft-lbs. They also report less significant remote neural effects in the hypothalamus with energy transfer just under 100 ft-lbs.[19]Even though Wang et al. document remote neural damage for low levels of energy transfer, these levels of neural damage are probably too small to contribute to rapid incapacitation. Courtney and Courtney suggest that remote neural effects only begin to make significant contributions to rapid incapacitation for ballistic pressure wave levels above 500 PSI (corresponds to transferring roughly 300 ft-lbs in 12 inches of penetration) and become easily observable above 1000 PSI (corresponds to transferring roughly 600 ft-lbs in 1 foot of penetration).[29]Incapacitating effects in this range of energy transfer are consistent with observations of remote spinal injuries,[15]observations of suppressed EEGs and breathing interruptions in pigs,[27][33]and with observations of incapacitating effects of ballistic pressure waves without a wound channel.[34]Other Scientific FindingsThe scientific literature contains other findings regarding injury mechanisms of ballistic pressure waves. Ming et al. report that ballistic pressure waves can break"
0,Scientific Evidence for Hydrostatic Shock,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3051v1,"Michael Courtney, Amy Courtney",Arxiv,8,"bones.[35] Tikka et al. reports abdominal pressure changes produced in pigs hit in one thigh.[36] Akimov et al. report on injuries to the nerve trunk from gunshot wounds to the extremities.[37]RecommendationsThe FBI recommends that loads intended for self-defense and law enforcement applications meet a minimum penetration requirement of 12 in ballistic gelatin.[8] Maximizing ballistic pressure wave effects requires transferring maximum energy in a penetration distance that meets this requirement. In addition, bullets that fragment and meet minimum penetration requirements generate higher pressure waves than bullets which do not fragment.  Understanding the potential benefits of remote ballistic pressure wave effects leads us to favor loads with at least 500 ft-lbs of energy.With a handgun, no wounding mechanism can be relied on to produce incapacitation 100% of the time within the short span of most gunfights.  Selecting a good self-defense load is only a small part of surviving a gunfight.  You have to hit an attacker to hurt him, and you need a good plan for surviving until your hits take effect.  Get good training, practice regularly, learn to use cover, and pray that you will never have a lethal force encounter armed only with a handgun.References1.Chamberlin FT, Gun Shot Wounds, in Handbook for Shooters and Reloaders, Vol. II, Ackley PO, ed., Plaza Publishing, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1966. 52.Ackley PO, Col.

When Profit is a Means to an End Profit can be more generative than you might imagine In a healthy economy, money is constantly circulating. This simple premise forms the basis of the entire economic model outlined in this book. Beneath ideology and political persuasion, this wisdom also sits within the hearts of each and every one of us. This can be seen in a simple experiment we have been conducting with diverse audiences since 2010.1  In the experiment, we ask audience members to draw a horizontal line across a page. Above the line, they are to draw a symbol, shape or simple image that represents a healthy, sustainable economy. Below the line, they replicate the process, but this time drawing something that represents our present economy. "

This principle of circulation must be built into the very way our economy functions; not as a side-effect, not as an afterthought, but as the way that economic activity naturally flows.  What we have now, in contrast, is a linear economy, focused on throughput, with massive amounts of resources going to waste, and money accumulating in the hands of a few. Keeping resources and money circulating in this economy is an afterthought, not an inherent feature of the system. In fact, many of us who are trying to work for a more sustainable economy often feel like were swimming upstream or fighting a doomed battle against the very rules of the economic system, itself.  																																																													1	Our	experiment	has	involved	audiences	that	include	students,	educators,	politicians,	investors,	CEOs,	environmentalists,	and	social	justice	activists.

The kind of business with which most of us are familiar is not the only kind of business. An entirely different model is sitting right in front of us and has gone mostly unnoticed, despite its increasingly large presence. And it points the way to the kind of healthy, balanced economy that so many of us desire. The economic model that were introducing in this book has the circulation of money written into its DNA. In our vision of the economy, all players are looked after through fair wages, and any surplus is fed back into the system. After all, when it comes to money, what more does anyone need than a good enough wage to cover todays expenses and to put something aside for the future? This approach is aligned with the principles of ecosystems, in which each animal and each species takes only what it needs and any surplus is passed on or left behind, to be used by other members of the ecosystem. Ecosystems dont have any equivalents of bloated savings accounts or offshore tax havens. The hoarding of wealth would be destructive to the system as a whole. Can you imagine lions in the savannah hunting all day to accumulate as much of a surplus of meat as possible, hiding it in a cave and every once in a while giving some to the vultures and hyenas? Its a laughable scenario. In reality, the lions hunt for as much food as they need, then spend the rest of the day resting"

They leave some of their kill behind for other species in the ecosystem to eat. If the lions accumulated more than they need, it would disrupt the entire food chain. They would decimate the species that they prey on. The vultures and hyenas would not have enough to eat and would starting dying off. And the numbers of vultures and hyenas in the savannah would affect the numbers of many other animals through their predatory patterns, which in turn would affect other species. The lions greed would not only decimate some species and deprive others of vital nutrition, but they might very well find themselves starving in the end, as the whole system breaks down. This is what is happening in our current system. Due to the structure and rules of our economy, a small minority has accumulated most of the money and this concentration is weakening the whole system. The key lies in what happens to the surplus in the economy.  The bold hypothesis we present in this book is that businesses that see profit as a means to achieving deeper goals will increasingly outperform those that prioritize profit as a goal in itself. Our main aim in this first chapter is to shed a new light on profit, re-formulate its place and potential in the world, and offer a glimpse of a much healthier economy based on this new perspective. The Potential of Profit What do you think of when you hear the word profit? What sort of thoughts and feelings"

Many of us think of a wide range of associated words all the way from greed, excess, and selfishness, to business, reward, and investment. We all have some sort of feelings about profit because it plays such a central role in society. Indeed, profit seems to make the world go round.    How	on	Earth		Working	draft	Hinton	&	Maclurcan	(2016)		9	Weve found that many people feel profit is a very positive thing; it motivates economic activity and keeps the invisible hand2 of the market going. It is the just reward for working hard and taking the risks of going into business. On the flip side, others feel that profit is inherently evil. It motivates all kinds of destructive behavior and encourages people to act selfishly and hoard wealth. And some of us have very mixed feelings about profit, acknowledging that it has both pros and cons.  Whatever feelings you have about profit, no one can deny its relevance. So its important for us to have a clear understanding of exactly what profit is and what it can be. Profit is simply the financial surplus generated by business activity, the difference between the amount earned and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing something.3 Thus, profit is neither inherently good nor bad. But, as the surplus of economic activity, it is important. And what happens to the surplus in our economy is central to whether we have a healthy or destructive economy.   We argue that, in order to determine whether business is generative (contributing to the health"

The Company that Changed Our Lives Many people know about the destructive activities that are carried out every day for the sake of maximizing profit. We constantly hear about how companies are profiting from the exploitation of workers in sweatshops, increasing their revenue by overfishing or cutting costs by cutting corners. But relatively few people are aware of the businesses and entrepreneurs all over the world that approach profit in a very different way, in a generative way. One such company sparked the idea for this book, and changed our lives forever.  In 2009, a man named Colin Saltmere gave a presentation at a conference in Brisbane, Australia. He described his civil engineering company, Myuma, as having 50 employees and an annual turnover of 17 million Australian dollars. He presented their work, which included the construction of roads in north-west Queensland. Then, Saltmere said five words that changed our lives, And were not-for-profit.   This was a paradigm-shifting moment for us. How could this company, which does so much work and generates so much revenue, be not-for-profit? Furthermore, if an engineering company could be not-for-profit, then might there be not-for-profit companies in other unlikely sectors of the economy, too? If so, would it be possible to have an entire economy based on not-for-profit business? Could that help us move beyond our current crises? The potential felt enormous. We had"

In a follow-up conversation, Saltmere told us that, as an Aboriginal group of engineers, they wanted to do work that would help the community. So they started their engineering firm as a not-for-profit (NFP). This means that Myuma is based on a social mission and that, after it has paid all its expenses, including wages, it must use 100% of its profits to fulfill its social mission. 																																																													2	The Invisible Hand is a concept first described by political philosopher Adam Smith in the late 1700s. A central concept in capitalism, it describes how the decisions of self-interested economic actors lead to the fair allocation of resources for all, through the mechanism of supply and demand, almost as if an invisible hand was moving the economy.

And, in fact, the entire economy should be based on generative businesses. With NFPs constantly cycling their surplus back into the real economy, the difference between for-profit and not-for-profit business could be the difference between having a linear, extractive economy and having a circular, generative economy. An economy based on NFP enterprise might be just what we need to move society in a more sustainable direction. It would take us beyond the current, stale debate about whether the market should be more heavily regulated or if it should be allowed to operate more freely, because"

As far as we know, this was a completely new vision of what the market could be. This could offer a realistic alternative to both capitalism and state socialism. Of course, many people had understood the generative nature of more socially-oriented businesses long before we started working on these ideas. People like Nobel Prize recipient, Muhammad Yunus, had been talking about social business for years. However, such visions focused on adding social purpose to business, regardless of the profit-orientation of a company. They hadnt seen the importance of the for-profit/NFP distinction in terms of expressing whether businesses see profit as a means to an end or as an end in itself. To our knowledge, no one had ever gone so far as to imagine that NFP business could stand alone, as the core of the economy.   Although we had both been working in the areas of environmentalism, social justice, sustainability and nonprofits for almost a decade, learning about Myuma gave us a new angle for investigation. Inspired by their story and excited about the potential of Myumas business model to transform the economy, we spent the next five years learning as much as possible about the landscape of NFP enterprise. What we found further fueled our enthusiasm. A significant amount of data had already been collected by the Center for Civil Society Studies at Johns Hopkins University.4 We were able to see from their work that the foundation"

Not-for-profit businesses are emerging all over the world and in every sector. Introducing Not-for-Profit Business In order to understand NFP business, we must first understand the most common form of business: for-profit business. Its quite simple. Most businesses have owners, shareholders and investors who expect to make money from the business. They expect whats called a return on investment. This means that they invest in the business expecting to get more money out than they put in. In most cases, they want to gain as much wealth from the company as possible, to maximize their gain. To this end, the majority of businesses are set up in order to maximize profits for their owners, shareholders and investors. This is business, as most of us know it. It seems natural that a business should have shareholders and investors, or at least owners, who receive a portion of the profit. In legal terms, though, there is a specific name for this type of business. It is aptly called for-profit business. 																																																													4	Salamon, L., et al., (2013), The State of Global Civil Society and Volunteering: Latest Findings from the Implementation of the UN Nonprofit Handbook, Baltimore, MD.

While the way for-profit businesses handle their financial surplus varies, and some of them may never make any profit, all for-profit companies have the ability to privately distribute profits. A company that can distribute profits to individuals (such as owners, shareholders, investors, partners,"

In such businesses, profit is either the main goal or one of the main goals of doing business. For-profit companies see profit not as a means to an end, but rather as an end itself.  But what if there were a business model oriented towards a deeper purpose and used profit as a means to achieving that purpose? What if there were a way of doing business that didnt have any private owners and had to use all of its profit  the surplus left over after paying for all business costs, including wages - for the good of the community rather than distributing it to private owners? Well, thats exactly what not-for-profit business is. Most of us have learned that businesses and nonprofits are two very different creatures. And traditionally, nonprofits and businesses have inhabited quite disparate realms. Businesses generate their own revenue and maximize profits, while nonprofits rely largely on charity and grants in order to do mission-driven work. In fact, the nonprofit world has long been dependent on the business world for financial support, in both direct and indirect ways. Historically, businesses have been the moneymakers, while nonprofits have been the caretakers. However, nonprofits are increasingly going into business to generate their own revenue and the status quo is rapidly changing. These trends are converging to create an entirely new sphere in the economy: the realm of NFP business. Not-for-profit businesses could be thought of as money-making caretakers. Indeed, NFP companies such as Bupa,"

The NFP ethos is very different from for-profit companies, which see the provision of goods and services as a way to earn profits, rather than the other way around. The for-profit mindset has put the cart before the horse. Not-for-profit business puts profit back into its proper place in the economy. Thus, we can distinguish between profit-ability (the ability to generate a financial surplus, thereby enhancing a businesss sustainability) and profit-maximization (the primary focus on maximizing profits). Companies like Myuma, Bupa and Mozilla illustrate that for-profit is not the only way to run a business. 																																																													5	Bupa (2015), ""Longer, Healthier, Happier Lives: Annual Report 2014,"" http://www.bupa.com/annualreport/pdf/bupa_full_report.pdf. 6	Mozilla (2014), ""Mozilla Foundation and Subsidiaries - 2013 Audited Financial Statements,"" https://static.mozilla.com/moco/en-US/pdf/Mozilla_Audited_Financials_2013.pdf.	7	Personal correspondance with author, SE Housing Coop.

What qualifies as a social or environmental mission? In many countries, the NFP definition allows for a very broad range of purposes. It includes missions that benefit the public at large, like protecting a"

It also includes missions that benefit a marginalized group of people, like impoverished families or people struggling with homelessness. It can also include missions that benefit a select group of people who arent vulnerable. NFP community centers and credit unions, for instance, exist for the benefit of their members, regardless of whether those members are struggling or not. An NFPs mission can even be as simple as providing high quality products. This gives us a very wide range of groups that can be NFP, which is why companies like Myuma, Bupa and Mozilla can be NFP.  However, this can also leave the door open for some organizations to register as NFPs that are actually in business to maximize wealth for private individuals. Some NFPs, such as mutual funds in the U.S., have the mission of providing high quality services to their customers, but their service is to maximize capital gains, which is the antithesis of the NFP legal distinction. As such, we exclude from our interpretation of not-for-profit any organization whose primary service is to maximize capital gains for individuals. Therefore, we could add as a fourth provision that NFPs: 4. Cannot have as their mission the maximization of capital gains for individuals or for-profit companies. Another feature that distinguishes many NFPs is one that further prevents private gain from an NFP: a windup clause (or asset lock) that prohibits any individual gain from company assets in the event that the entity closes down or is dissolved."

Legislation that allows NFPs to distribute their assets to individuals blurs the for-profit/NFP distinction. For instance, an NFP golf club should not be able to distribute its assets to individual members when the company dissolves. Instead, all of those assets should be passed on to other NFPs (this is legally required of all 501c(3)s in the U.S. and all Community Interest Companies in the U.K.). Otherwise, individuals can make quite a significant capital gain from the golf clubs assets. Distribution of an NFPs assets can also create a litigation nightmare, in terms of who gets what, especially if people have donated to the NFP.  On their own, each of the elements above could not transform the economy.

Yet, around the world, NFPs can make as much profit9 as they want. In fact, without any financial surplus, they might not be able to invest in stronger operations or withstand dips in income. Not-for-profit means just what it says: making a profit is not the primary purpose of these organizations. Such companies do not exist for profit; they exist for a deeper purpose. Rather than focusing on profit as a goal itself, profit is a tool to help them achieve their mission.  This misunderstanding that NFPs cannot make a profit leads people to think of NFPs as distinct from social enterprises, sustainable businesses or cooperatives. Many entrepreneurs feel they must choose between starting a social enterprise or an NFP. Or they feel that running a sustainable business means that it must be for-profit. In fact, the term for-profit is hardly ever used in discussions about business, because its taken for granted that all businesses are for-profit, by default. This perception is finally shifting. Social enterprises, sustainable businesses, cooperatives, and even multinational corporations can all be NFP. The key factor that differentiates NFPs from for-profit business is that they must put all of their profits back into their social mission and cannot distribute any portion of profits to individuals (such as workers, management and board directors). This is an age-old distinction, but never before has it been so important because never before have so many NFPs been doing so much business.

Some readers might wonder if there is a difference between an NFP using financial surplus to increase salaries the next year and a for-profit company distributing its financial surplus to owners at the end of the year. The difference is profound. Not-for-profit employees are paid to do valuable work without which the NFP could not survive. In other words, they earn their salaries by creating value. Furthermore, when the manager of an NFP submits a budget to the NFPs board for review, the board considers this budget in light of both the companys financial position and the efficient allocation of resources needed to achieve its mission. Salaries are generally only raised if doing so will help the NFP better fulfill its purpose.

In the for-profit context, purposes other than profit are generally taken into account only if doing so will help the company deliver higher profits. The focus on profit-maximization encourages short-term thinking, speculative behavior, and cutting costs (often reducing wages and lowering the quality of products and services). Good NFP salaries, on the other hand, promote longer-term thinking and further value creation for the company and the community it serves, because profit and wages are in service of a deeper purpose.  Its not just the way that NFP enterprises are transforming the business world that changes the game; its also how theyre transforming the world of traditional nonprofits. As more and more NFPs move into business, it also becomes important to distinguish between traditional, charity-dependent nonprofits and NFP businesses. Often the terms nonprofit and not-for-profit are used interchangeably, but we make a distinction in this book. We believe that the mindset and economic role of NFP enterprise is so different from that of traditional nonprofits that it is worth recognizing it as a totally new category, as a new segment of the economy. We have chosen to use the terms NFP business, NFP enterprise, or simply an NFP to differentiate this new breed of purpose-based businesses from traditional nonprofits, which"

We decided to use these terms because nonprofit tends to evoke more of the no-profit misunderstanding, while Not-for-Profit is more straightforward in describing the mission of the company, or rather, what its mission is not. Its not for-profit.10  Why define something by what it is not? If all NFP businesses are driven by purpose, why not speak of for-benefit or for-purpose businesses? We intentionally avoid such language, because the words benefit and purpose are too vague to show what happens with a companys surplus. They leave the questions of who benefits? and for what purpose? unanswered. This is clearly illustrated by the fact that the benefit corporation in the U.S. is actually a for-profit business model and the B Corp certification (B as in benefit) is only available to for-profit companies.11  Although in most countries there is no legal distinction between traditional nonprofits and NFP enterprises, for the purposes for this book, when we refer to an NFP business or enterprise we include organizations that generate at least 50%12 of their funding from the sale of goods and services. This means that NFP enterprises can receive ongoing philanthropy and grants, but cannot depend on these for the majority of their revenue.  Not-for-profit enterprises are able to use strategic business approaches to generate revenue that go far beyond raising money via grants, donations and other forms of philanthropy.

For now, the take-away message is that NFP business is mission-oriented and uses all resources, including profit, to achieve social or environmental goals, whereas for-profit business is profit-oriented and can distribute profit to private individuals.  We are explaining these distinctions so thoroughly because the NFP framework is so widely misunderstood, and yet it is a necessary ingredient in any recipe for a healthier economy. With NFP businesses largely geared towards the greater good, profit tends to be constructive and generative. This is because NFPs generate surplus with the intention of being better able to achieve their social or environmental goals. With for-profit businesses largely geared towards"

Such companies face many of the same challenges that for-profit companies experience, such as achieving sustainable streams of revenue. They also face many of the same challenges that traditional nonprofits encounter, such as drifting from their mission. However, an economy built on the NFP framework and ethic is healthier for people and the planet than an economy founded on the for-profit framework and ethic.

The Business Spectrum Although were drawing a line in the sand between for-profit and NFP business, its important to acknowledge that not all for-profit businesses are created with the same single-minded drive towards profit. Many small, locally-owned businesses do not maintain a singular focus on profit and are often happy to forgo revenue for a cause that helps their community, such as donating goods and services to homeless shelters. In addition to companies that voluntarily act in less profit-oriented ways, we also see the emergence of new legal business models that seek to push for-profit business in a more purpose-driven direction. The benefit corporation, for example, is a relatively new for-profit business model introduced in some U.S. states, whose legal structure was designed to enable the profit-orientation of the 																																																													14	Salamon, L., et al., 2013.

Benefit corporations subscribe to the triple bottom line philosophy; seeking to balance people, planet and profit. Note that profit is still a goal in itself, rather than just a means to help meet the needs of people and planet. Benefit corporations are therefore predisposed to the for-profit ethic. Many people have also heard of social enterprises, which are often either assumed to be all for-profit, or all NFP."

For-profit social enterprises fall into the triple bottom line category  seeking to balance profit as a goal alongside social or environmental goals.  Worker-owned cooperatives are another example of less profit-oriented businesses that are legally for-profit. Owned and managed by the workers themselves, profits of a worker co-op can be distributed to individuals, making worker co-ops for- profit. And, in addition to their wages, workers usually look forward to their dividend from profits. The worker-owned co-op model is still based on the profit motive and the for-profit ethic, but to a much lesser extent than typical for-profit corporations. And, of course, worker co-ops distribute their profit more equitably than companies that only give profit to a narrow group of shareholders and investors. In fact, sometimes worker co-ops even choose to limit the maximum amount that can be paid out in dividends. Benefit corporations, for-profit social enterprises and worker co-ops all represent important steps away from the strictly profit-oriented mentality of corporations traded on the stock market, which prioritize delivering higher quarterly profits for shareholders. They are a move in the NFP direction and play an important part in a larger trend that were observing.

You can see from the vertical position on the graph that profit is the number one priority for such companies; they seek to maximize profit. Benefit corporations have private owners and shareholders who dont work for the business, but they have a social purpose in addition to their desire to maximize profit. Many small family-owned companies, also known as mom and pop shops, would be near the center, because the owners of these companies usually do a certain amount of work for the business and profit is rarely the singular priority.

What is it? We call it the Wealth Extraction Siphon.                 Wealth Extraction Siphon This is how it works. For-profit businesses distribute surplus to owners, investors and shareholders. They then use their wealth primarily to invest in more business ownership (equity) to receive more profits and capital gains. They receive more wealth from the returns on their investments and use that new wealth to invest in more equity, and so it continues in a feedback loop. The people who own the most equity in businesses are the wealthiest people in society and their wealth allows them to buy even more equity in businesses (they dont need to go into debt to do this), so they are able to multiply their wealth like no one else. This does contribute to the wealth circulation pump to an extent, as the capitalists businesses pay wages, allowing their employees to continue to buy the things they need. But their aim is to take out more than they put in and they do that very well. Thus, their activities extract more wealth than they circulate, which is why capitalism has an overall trend towards greater inequality.17 The little amount of wealth that trickles down from the rich simply cannot compensate for the speed at which wealth is being extracted from"

Most of us believe that the stock market serves primarily as a mechanism of investment - that when people buy shares in a company, they are investing in that company and providing it with the capital it needs to grow. However, this is only the case when a company offers shares on whats called the primary market for the first time, through an Initial Public Offering, or via a further stock issuance. The vast majority of stock market transactions happen in the secondary market (like the New York Stock Exchange), and do not give companies any capital or investment funds.23 Rather this is the domain of pure speculation.

The for-profit system encourages speculation and short-term thinking; two ingredients that have proven to be extremely destructive on a planet that we must all share and look after for future generations.

Thus, in our current global economy, profits are generally created in the most cost-efficient ways, regardless of social and ecological consequences. A very clear example of this is how profit-maximization has been driving companies to outsource labor, often moving factories to countries where wages are lower and environmental, health and safety regulations are lax or nonexistent. This is largely done in order to increase shareholder value, deliver higher profits to owners, and stay competitive against other companies that are also trying to maximize profits. Planned obsolescence is also symptomatic of this tendency to maximize profit at all costs.  Products are often designed to break down or become obsolete as soon as possible so that consumers will buy more items more frequently. It feels like every year the things we buy are less and less durable and need to be replaced more frequently. Most of us have experienced this when a household item like a printer or vacuum cleaner stops working and we take it to a shop to be repaired, only to be told that it would be cheaper to simply buy a newer version of the product. In part, this is because companies are using cheaper materials and cheaper production methods to maximize profits.26 But even if products dont physically break down, companies find ways to keep their profit margins high, such as selling software that becomes incompatible with newer applications after a year or two.

A Brief History of Profit To believe that a different set of rules and standards is even possible, it helps to know a little more about how dramatically the approaches to profit and the wider economy have changed over time.  In the 1970s, philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn described how paradigm shifts occur in science. A paradigm is simply the most common way of understanding the world around us, a frame of thinking that includes both assumptions and the way information is interpreted. Kuhn claimed that scientific paradigms are constantly developing and evolving but that from time to time, a paradigm shift happens when the old way of doing science no longer seems valid or effective and new ways of seeing the world emerge to explain the phenomena that the old paradigm couldnt. Kuhn noted as an example the famous paradigm shift that happened in the field of astronomy when Galileo was able to use a telescope to show how the Earth revolves around the sun. Before that, most astronomers based all of their calculations and theories on the assumption that the Earth was the center of the universe and the sun, as well as all other planets, revolved around Earth. However, there were things that the geo-centric view couldnt explain. As a result, the existing paradigm faced a crisis and a"

Just as there have been paradigm shifts in the way we understand the universe, so have there been shifts in the way we see the economy. The concept of profit is central to these economic paradigm shifts. As our social, political and cultural needs change, so does our idea of what should be done with economic surplus. This means that the way we organize society and politics, as well as the cultural context in which businesses are embedded, influences our understanding of profit and vice versa.  These aspects are all constantly co-evolving. The same is true for concepts like business, ownership, and markets. We inevitably interpret these ideas through our cultural lens or filter.

These foraging bands focused on satisfying human needs,30 which they saw as limited.31, 32 The forager worldview clearly entails an ethic of enough. While forager economies did not involve surplus production, the peasant communities which were common in ancient civilizations did. These societies typically responded to surplus by institutionalizing wealth-leveling practices that periodically redistributed any marked difference in individual material wealth. Their customs ensured that inevitable differences in productivity and fortune did not disrupt the social stability of the community.   Indeed, redistributive practices such as this can still be found across many indigenous cultures.33 They are powerful reminders that other ways of treating surplus beyond private accumulation have long existed and that the present model of wealth accumulation that dominates our lives is a relatively new development in human history. In socio-economic systems where redistributive practices are institutionalized, people are motivated by cultural goals which can only be achieved by putting the surplus back into social institutions.34 Surplus becomes simply the vehicle for achieving social respect, and does not lead to differences in access to resources.  Such customs are supported by cultural assumptions and worldviews that typically stigmatize greed, over-consumption and hoarding.

Thus, the Pre-Profit Era gave way to the For- Profit Era. In this paradigm, profit became a goal in itself and it was explicitly used to support an elite class.37  These early societies had cultural and social institutions that allowed divinely-ordained elites to claim ownership of goods produced by lower-ranking people.38 Only the elites got to keep surplus and commoners faced accusations of theft if they did so.39 For most of the For-Profit Era, private accumulation of surplus by commoners remained morally problematic, largely due to cultural narratives that considered the privatization of profit socially unacceptable and, in many cases, damnable under religious teaching.40 Luca Pacioli, an Italian mathematician that lived in the 15th century, echoed the Bibles teaching that all wealth belongs to God,41 a statement that exemplifies the most common attitude towards wealth accumulation and private profit at that time. And, of course, with the advent of Islam in the 6th century AD, the majority of banks in the Muslim world were forbidden to charge interest under Sharia law. Elites in most societies were also expected to use their wealth to erect lavish public buildings, to fund annual community festivities and to perform ritual functions.42 European nobility, for example, used their family wealth to erect the palaces, churches and fortresses. Power could only be demonstrated by culturally-appropriate displays of wealth, and noblesse oblige was expected.

Known as the Invisible Hand of the market economy, Smiths most influential idea45 was that if each individual acts out of their own self-interest in the marketplace, it will add up to social benefit for all, because everyone will find the best way to meet their own needs. As capitalism took hold through the Industrial Revolution, personal gain acted as the main motivation for conducting and expanding business activity. The profit motive was born. For the first time in history, it became widely accepted that a common person, not related to nobility, royalty or the church, could hope to financially gain from business.46 Little wonder it became so intoxicating. The co-evolution of the English language with the profit motive clearly illustrates the corresponding shift in cultural values. For instance, the word wealth emerged in the English language in the 14th century and originally meant wellbeing, related to health or bodily well-being. Only later did the term come to be synonymous with material possessions and money.47 The same goes for prosperity, which originally meant happiness.48  As economies shifted from mercantilism to capitalism, corporations and limited liability companies became popular vehicles for doing business. Before 1819, corporate charters in the U.S. were only issued if it was in the publics interest and they were tightly regulated by the government.49 Forming a corporation back then usually required a legislative act. All investors generally had an equal say in corporate governance and corporations had to align their activities with the"

A corporations charter could be revoked by the state if the corporation was not acting for the common good and many charters were dissolved as soon as their projects came to an end.50, 51 In essence, until 1819, corporations in the U.S. had to be socially-oriented, 																																																													43	Ibid	44	Skidelsky, R., ""Life after Capitalism,"" Al Jazeera, July 7, 2011, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/07/201176105512730267.html. 45	The Invisible Hand is such a significant part of Smiths legacy not because he put so much emphasis on it, but rather because political philosophers and economists who came after him praised the idea. Many scholars believe that the concept is commonly misunderstood (see Merropol for instance) (Ref: Meeropol).

Hence, we find ourselves in the transition period between two eras. More effective ways of viewing the economy, business and profit are evolving and ushering in a new age.  Although for-profit business has taken center stage since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, it has not been the only model in the business ecosystem. There were also many formative not- for-profit developments in the 19th century. This is when cooperatives were first formed in order to unite for the benefit of all members through collective ownership and democratic management of the business, a step in the NFP direction. This is also when the first formal nonprofits emerged as legal vehicles for charity work and philanthropy. Early nonprofit organizations found ways to raise money for their cause, in addition to relying on donations. Some did even raise funds through the sale of goods and services, such as the Goodwill thrift shops started in 1895 by Reverand Edgar J. Helms.53 These were the first enterprising nonprofits. After the Second World War, we saw the development of welfare states throughout the West, as a manifestation of a new sense of responsibility for taking care of all of the citizens of a nation. This new sense of responsibility coincided with the emergence of not-for-profit enterprise in more or less the same form"

These businesses have chosen to incorporate as NFPs because its the ideal framework to ensure they remain 100% dedicated to their social mission and it is the best way of showing their customers and communities that theyll never be tempted to compromise in the name of speculation and greed.

All of this new evidence points to something that many of us have intuited for a very long time: human nature is malleable. It is not this or that; its this and that. Human nature is far from being black and white and is better thought of as existing along gradated spectrums ranging from generous to greedy, from thrifty to gluttonous, from cooperative to competitive, and everything in between. To paraphrase the great Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: the line separating good from evil runs not between people, but through every human heart.  We display different aspects of human nature, depending on social norms as well as the extent to which our fundamental needs are met. Perhaps the best word to describe human nature, then, is complex. If our needs are not being adequately met or if we feel resources are scarce, we tend to express the competitive, greedy aspects of human nature.71 If our needs are being met in healthy ways, we express the more compassionate, cooperative aspects of human nature.72  What are the needs that have such a big impact on whether we act from a place of altruism or greed? You might be familiar with Maslows hierarchy of needs.73 We find the work of one theorist even more valuable.

Without fulfilling their own needs, they wouldnt be able to contribute to the whole. This is interdependence. This understanding of interdependence was embedded in many ancient cultures and remains an integral part of many indigenous societies today. Fortunately, this wisdom is re-emerging in different forms all over the world. Movements such as the sharing economy, the solidarity economy, open source innovation, peer-to-peer networks and a growing focus on taking care of the commons all show the eagerness of people to work for the greater good. In fact, a significant portion of the worlds trade has always occurred, and continues to occur, without the profit motive.76 In the country of Mali, for example, 17% of all trade, including education and healthcare delivery, happens within whats often called the gift economy.77 Goods and services are shared without the expectation of any direct reciprocation.  Even in fully industrialized economies, a great amount of economic activity is not profit- motivated. In 1996, economist Duncan Ironmonger estimated that the value of goods and services produced by unpaid workers in Australian households was almost the same as the value of the goods and services that paid workers produced for the Australian market.78 This is the caring economy; parents, family members, friends and neighbors looking after each other in ways that arent accounted for by most economists.

The NFP approach is fundamentally different in terms of depth, scope and goals, and it is quickly gaining advantages in the market.

In a world with rising demand for ethical products and services, organizations that focus on fulfilling human and ecological needs are ahead of the game. Not-for-profit businesses dont have dividends to worry about and can often offer lower prices, primarily because they are NFP. They often receive tax exemptions and the ability to receive tax deductible donations.

In fact, many NFP enterprises have a mission to help regenerate ecosystems. The NFP World fosters a more equitable economy because it naturally leads to a more balanced distribution of wealth. The requirement that NFP businesses reinvest all their profit into their mission translates into the constant circulation of wealth throughout the whole economy. Money and other resources go to where theyre needed most, as the market is made up of mission-driven businesses. Thus, wealth, power and other benefits are distributed more widely and this is particularly important in light of our current inequality crisis.

In an economy in which wealth concentrates, we consume more but have less, whereas in an economy in which wealth circulates, we consume less but have more.  In the for-profit world, we have less social connection, less free time, and less relative wealth. We consume more goods and services in order to compensate for not having enough of the stuff that makes life truly worthwhile. We have too much material wealth and not enough immaterial wealth.

What could possibly explain the fact that wages and employment in nonprofits actually rose, while they fell in the for-profit sector? These numbers tell a story about the direction our economy might be heading. The economic crisis of the last eight years has had very different impacts on the for-profit and nonprofit sectors of the economy. As the financial industry experienced big hits that sent shockwaves throughout the global economy, slowing economic growth in most of the developed world, for-profit companies experienced major losses. As a result, they laid off employees and decreased wages in order to cut costs, as the statistics above show. They also had to decrease their sponsorship and philanthropic giving to nonprofits. This meant sink or swim for much of the nonprofit sector. Instead of falling victim to the decline in grants, donations and philanthropy, many nonprofits recruited volunteers, board members and managers with a background in business and quickly"

Now there is a different approach that many are adopting: shifting to an enterprise model. As a result, nonprofits are steadily moving into the market. These NFP companies are selling goods, offering services on a sliding-scale fee basis, and even leasing their property in strategic ways. Data from all over the world shows that nonprofits are increasingly developing business plans and revenue models that enable financial independence.888990 This trend has been strengthening in the last few years and the nonprofit sectors of 27 countries are increasingly generating their own income through various forms of self-managed business.91  In 2013, nonprofits in the U.S. reported over $1.74 trillion in revenue, 72 percent of which came from program fees and contract work.92 Nonprofit revenues in the U.S. grew at a rate of 41 percent from 2000 to 2010.93  Forty-five percent of registered charities in the U.K. currently identify themselves as social"

Many organizations still operate from the mindset of being the nonprofit sidekick of the for-profit economy. They see themselves as being the people who require philanthropy and donations to do the good work that business is too busy making money to do. This dependence-mindset is part of these organizations internal culture. They maintain this dependence by using a great deal of their time and resources to apply for grants and ask for donations and philanthropy.

Theres almost the feeling that charging people for goods and services that benefit the community will cheapen their work or twist their ethics. Theres a prevailing idea, not just among nonprofits, but throughout society, that business and charity are two very different things that should not be mixed.  But shouldnt all businesses be set up to benefit society? Should companies provide goods and services that dont benefit society? Or goods and services that actually harm society, just in order to make money, and then donate a bit of that money to try to compensate for the harm theyve caused or the gap that they havent filled, because it wouldnt make them as much money? Traditional nonprofits that maintain the dependence-mindset arent asking these important questions. And they arent doing themselves or society any favors by staying in a position of dependence. Dependence on philanthropy and grants often means that nonprofits must prioritize the funders goals over their own. This can be detrimental to the nonprofits mission.

An article published in 2005 in the Harvard Business Review, titled Should nonprofits seek profits?, warned against nonprofits trying to earn their own income.97 The authors believed that going into business was just too risky for nonprofits, because so many income-earning endeavors fail in the nonprofit space and society cannot afford for nonprofits to fail, as their services are so important in helping the disadvantaged.  The article describes how one nonprofits manager came to see their attempt at earning income through a restaurant-caf as the best way to attract grants and philanthropy, even though the restaurant was actually costing more money than it was generating. The author used this example to illustrate that nonprofits simply dont have the right mentality to run a business, as if this is an inherent flaw of being nonprofit.  The author is right; that specific organizations failure is probably mostly due to the dependence-mindset being so deeply ingrained that they even saw their business as a way of attracting donors, rather than as a way of generating income to be self-sufficient. A manager with this mindset, who is so focused on the idea of fundraising, will probably not be very good at keeping a business going; if for no reason other than the fact that he or she will constantly be distracted from the business by thinking of ways to get more grants and donors.

Such independence gives NFPs more self-confidence to get their mission done as well. This is another problem with the dependence-mentality in nonprofits that often goes unarticulated. Being dependent makes them feel that they can only accomplish so much on their own. Just like an individual who is financially dependent on someone else; they feel bound and limited. Being more self-sufficient, on the other hand, gives them a sense of empowerment, although it sometimes takes more work. Theres also a different sense of pride in the work one does when it is self-directed. This is just as true for organizations as it is for individuals.

You can do it how you want to do it for as long as you want to do it and you dont have to make anybody happy except your own board and staff. You dont have to meet anybody elses expectations. Thats a very freeing idea, and once you feel it, you dont want to go back to the confines of any other type of funding.98   An article on the popular website Fast Company tells the story of VolunteerMatch, an American NFP that helps volunteers go to where theyre needed most. VolunteerMatch has been reaping the many benefits of doing more business. The organization went from generating 57% of its revenue from service fees in 2006, to generating 87% of its own revenue in 2009. Greg Baldwin, the president of VolunteerMatch, proudly remarked in an interview, We are almost completely sustainable due to earned revenue. And because of that element of financial viability, Baldwin is optimistic that the company will be able to better serve tens of thousands of nonprofits in coming years, creating even more positive social outcomes.99  Likewise, the YHA recreation and accommodation provider in the United Kingdom generates 95%"

This is a hugely empowering shift for the nonprofit sector.   Not only is the percentage of self-generated income rising within the nonprofit sector, but NFP companies are also expanding their reach into new areas of business. Markets traditionally dominated by for-profit business, such as construction, manufacturing, software development, food catering and retail, are all arenas for not-for-profit business now.  Business Built for Purpose You might be wondering how so many different kinds of businesses can possibly be not-for-profit. Sure, they might not privately distribute profit, but what about their social mission?  In most countries, the definition of social benefit or charitable purpose is flexible enough to include any kind of mission, other than generating profit, that has some sort of positive social outcome. Some countries, like the UK, determine this by evaluating whether a business does more good than harm for society. This allows for a very broad range of businesses, not just the usual suspects like education, healthcare and community development.  For example, in the retail sector, the Eco-Home Centre is a registered NFP business in Cardiff, Wales, which sells home renovation and construction supplies. Its mission is to champion sustainable building in Walesiii.102   In fashion and design, there are companies like Bombolulu in Kenya, which employs people with various disabilities to produce jewelry, textiles, as well as wood and leather products that are sold worldwide through Fair Trade Organizations.103    Law firms and"

All of these insurance companies exist to provide the best, most affordable insurance coverage they can to their customers and all profits are invested back into that mission.  You can also find NFPs in the transportation industry. The Independent Transportation Network in the U.S. is dedicated to providing dignified transportation for senior citizens and it has over 4000 members, all of whom are also NFP businesses.110   There are NFP breweries, like Ex Novo in Portland, Oregon, which has the mission of providing the community with good beer and gives 100% of its profits to charities that help disadvantaged communities.111 This might sound just like a for-profit brewery that simply donates to charity, but this brewery has no private owners as well as a clear mission that is not related to profit. This means that it wont be tempted to sell as much beer at as a high a price and as low a cost as possible, potentially sacrificing the quality of the product and the working conditions of employees in order to turn a profit for owners and investors.

Any profit generated from these business activities goes to making the disability services they provide even more affordable and accessible.113  Relying more on earned income exposes NFPs to competition in the marketplace, usually resulting in more efficient and effective operations. Increased cash flow means that their beneficiaries benefit even more.  In an era when inequality is skyrocketing, a large portion of our planets ecosystems are facing collapse, and levels of wellbeing all over the world are declining, its no longer enough for the business world to try to minimize or mitigate its negative impacts. We need companies that generate positive outcomes for the whole living community, not just a handful of wealthy business owners and investors. We need an economy that is generative, not extractive. Fortunately, the kind of generative business model that so many of us have been seeking already exists. Not-for-profit business is better for people and the planet. This is not because all NFP businesses are perfectly eco-friendly and ethical in their activities. Not-for-profit companies are simply much more likely to work for positive social and environmental outcomes than for-profits because they:  exist for a social or environmental purpose;  see profit only as a means of achieving a deeper purpose, not as the goal itself;   have a board to hold the company accountable to that purpose;   are held accountable by the larger public for staying mission-oriented;  have no private owners or shareholders (so no one"

NFP is truly a business model built for purpose. It represents economic activity that focuses on meeting social and environmental needs. Because the NFP business model doesnt require constant growth in order to maximize profits, it allows us to acknowledge the fact that some needs are best met outside of the market. Based on the ethic of enough and the purpose motive, NFP business is a lot less likely to pressure people to consume for consumptions sake, which is good for all the inhabitants of this planet.  Unlike in the for-profit world, where business is fundamentally at odds with ecological limits because companies must constantly grow, NFP enterprises are much more likely to take environmental issues seriously, and to constantly seek to reduce their ecological footprints.

An NFP can much more easily get away with not making a profit year after year in order to be more eco-friendly in its business activities.  Due to the different values and greater levels of accountability in the NFP business world, there is also a deeper consideration for consumers real needs. CarShare in Colorado makes this very clear on their website, which says, Were committed to helping our members share more than just cars. We want to promote community through a shared sense of purpose. By sharing the costs of car ownership, more resources will be available for the things that truly matter  like clean air, water, and open space instead of parking lots. Shared vehicles, in combination with urban cycling and reliable transit, give our nonprofit model the leverage to partner with virtually unlimited opportunities and offer our members the lowest rates possible.115  NFP enterprises are also more inclusive. Such businesses have a predisposition toward democratic decision-making, transparency, fairness, and equality, which builds trust and inclusivity. If you think about which companies make a point of employing people with disabilities in your community, names of NFPs will most likely come to mind.

Its almost as if weve accepted that the profit motive naturally leads to these negative consequences, but that its the only way to do business, therefore for-profit enterprise is a necessary evil. The NFP business model offers a real alternative. It raises the bar, setting a much higher ethical standard for business.  As such, we argue that moving beyond for-profit business is not only possible, but it is necessary for a more sustainable worldv.  Ownership and Assets In light of the extreme inequality of the 21st century, one of the most significant aspects of the NFP model is that it invites us to re-imagine business ownership. Ownership of businesses, and of the means of production, is so central to any economy that it has the power to shift an entire economic paradigm.  Strictly speaking, no one can own an NFP. Not-for-profit businesses can have managers, boards and CEOs, but no owners or shareholders. Anytime you hear of member-owned NFP co-ops or having a membership share in an NFP, its purely nominal. Your share is only what you put in; it cant grow and it cant be traded. So, an NFP share is more like a refundable deposit and the so-called owners dont have any equity. Nobody can really own a share of an NFP or hold equity in it, other than another NFP.119  This is an extremely important point of distinction between NFP and for-profit businesses.

This caretaking approach demonstrates the ethic of enough inherent in the NFP model. The employees of an NFP are compensated through their salaries and theres generally a limit to how much NFP managers and CEOs can receive. In many parts of the world, this relies on a reasonability test, in which an NFP must prove why a high salary is justified. This is usually done by referring to salaries in peer organizations. Extremely high salaries, like those of many for-profit CEOs, are deemed unacceptable in NFPs by tax agencies and courts of law. Dividends from for-profit companies, on the other hand, have no defined limits. Indeed, most shareholders want their dividends to be as large as possible, and this is a rational and socially acceptable response in light of the prevailing system conditions. Thus, dividends and private equity represent an ethic of never enough, as they can (and should) always be bigger from one year to the next. 																																																													118	Wilkinson,	R.G.	&	Pickett,	K.,	2009	119	Glaeser,	E.

Rather, most countries laws require that, upon closing down, an NFPs assets must be used to further the organizations mission or given to other NFPs. Thus, the assets and wealth stay in the NFP system  and in the real economy. Just as nobody can get rich from an NFPs profit, no one can get rich from an NFPs assets either.  The only area of NFP business in which weve found that the asset-lock is somewhat ambiguous is when it comes to cooperatives. We have not found any legislation that governs what happens to the assets of NFP cooperatives when they shut down. However, in practice, it is basically unheard of for anyone to make a financial gain from assets when an NFP cooperative is dissolved, because it is much easier for the co-op members to decide to donate assets to another co-op than to decide how to divide the assets among a large number of members who all deserve an equal share. In some places, it is considered standard practice for co-ops that are closing down to give all assets to other co-ops, in accordance with the cooperative spirit. Italy has a special national cooperative development fund that promotes the creation of other cooperatives, and when a co-op is dissolved, all remaining assets are transferred to this fund.121  If an NFP business is dissolving and owes money to a lender, the debt owed can usually"

An NFP must justify any transfer of assets or money upon winding down and most tax agencies scrutinize this process very thoroughly to ensure that nobody is benefitting, except for other NFPs. In many places, there are provisions for ensuring that individuals cannot even indirectly make a financial gain from an NFP. For instance, in the U.S., NFPs cannot pay contractors above the market rate (called excess benefit transactions by the Internal Revenue Service). This is basically an inbuilt mechanism that reduces corruption and nepotism in the NFP business sector. No one can own an NFP or its assets, but an NFP entity itself can own land and assets. An NFP can also own other businesses and hold equity in them, but because nobody owns the NFP, it acts like a steward or caretaker of the land, assets and businesses it owns.  Subsidiaries Because nobody can own a not-for-profit business, each NFP is best thought of as owning itself.

For example, Jamie Olivers gourmet restaurant, Fifteen, in London is owned by the Jamie Oliver Foundation, a charity.122 All of Fifteens profits go to the NFP foundation, which uses all of its funds to achieve its stated goal: to shape the health and wellbeing of current and future generations and contribute to a healthier world by providing better access to food education for everyone.123  All profits go to a social mission, so it doesnt really matter much whether the subsidiary, Fifteen, is registered as a for-profit or not-for-profit. Because it is owned by the foundation, it is in effect an extension of the not-for-private-profit, essentially making it NFP as well. However, if Fifteen, as a for-profit company, was legally able to own the Jamie Oliver Foundation (which its not legally able to - this is a hypothetical example), it would mean that Fifteen, which can distribute profits to individuals, would be able to siphon money out of the foundation into private pockets. This is why an NFP can own a for-profit, but not the other way around. Similarly, Tait Communications, a global communications company based in New Zealand, is a for-profit subsidiary of an NFP foundation. Tait sells communications devices, such as the portable radio systems used by emergency response teams, and all of Taits profits go to research and development, educational programs and other charitable purposes through its owner, the foundation, as was the vision of the companys founder, Sir Angus Tait.124  Likewise, the well-known American"

Its completely natural for the Eco-Home Centre in Wales to sell building products as part of its mission to support sustainable building. Its business activities are undeniably related to its mission. But its easier to do this for certain missions than others. For instance, what sort of business activities might be related to offering rehabilitation for substance abuse? What sort of business activities might be related to providing shelter to the homeless? This is where subsidiaries can be extremely helpful for NFPs. An impressive example of this is Housing Works Bookstore Cafe in New York City.

One of the most successful examples of this model in the U.S. is the 35-year social enterprise partnership between FEI Behavioral Health, a for-profit workforce resilience and crisis management company, and its single shareholder (i.e.  sole owner), the Alliance for Strong Families and Communities, an NFP family services organization. Since beginning this social enterprise structure in 1979, FEI has provided more than $30 million of financial support to the Alliance, its members, and the communities they serve.127   A Better Way Ministries in Newnan, Georgia, is a drug rehabilitation and gospel outreach program that employs the men in its care in a number of small, profitable subsidiary companies, including an auto detailing business, a bakery and a moving company. The money generated by these satellite companies allows the parent organization to earn income while helping the program recipients earn a living through engagement in the program. A study by the Yale School of Management and the Goldman Sachs Foundation on enterprising nonprofits, found that having a subsidiary business to fund its social mission has a positive effect on the overall reputation and mindset of the NFP, improving its reputation, mission, service and program delivery, entrepreneurial culture, self-sufficiency, and its ability to attract and retain donors and staff.128  A very early example of this is Greyston Bakery, which is a for-profit subsidiary of the Greyston Foundation, in New York City. Greystons mission is to employ and train people who are commonly perceived as unemployable, including former drug addicts, prisoners, and recovering alcoholics. Greyston"

For instance, under U.S. law, Housing Works might have a difficult time explaining how selling coffee is related to their mission to help people suffering from AIDS and homelessness. To avoid any problems, they started a subsidiary and, as a for-profit, their subsidiary doesnt have to have a social mission at all.

Perhaps it would have been better if National Geographic Media were registered as an NFP subsidiary from the start, rather than a for-profit subsidiary, to ensure that a for-profit company could never own it. After all, educating people through the magazines content is a perfectly acceptable social mission for an NFP to have. As the example of National Geographic illustrates, it is wise for an NFP to start a not-for-profit subsidiary with a different social mission, rather than a for-profit subsidiary, when possible. This enables an NFP to enjoy the advantages that a for-profit subsidiary would offer, without the risk of it one day being privately-owned and operated for private profit. A great example of an NFP subsidiary is Tender Funerals, in New South Wales, Australia. Tender Funerals itself is a not-for-profit, and it is owned and run by another NFP called Our Community Project.132 Its wonderful to know that nobody is making a financial gain from Tenders funeral services. Instead the company uses any surplus to provide better services to the community.

For-profit companies often have boards, too, but there are some crucial differences between for-profit and NFP boards. First of all, the mission of for-profits is to maximize profit, so boards hold the company accountable for maximizing profit, or in the case of triple bottom line businesses, balancing profit as a goal with social and environmental concerns. In fact, most corporate boards are primarily tasked with protecting the shareholders interests.134, 135 An NFP board protects the interests of the community and holds the company accountable for working towards its stated social and environmental goals.

Not-for-profit boards can work directly with managers and with workers, to decide whats best for the organization. It might sound like the NFP board adds a layer of bureaucracy that could slow a business down, but boards do not typically make many management decisions. The management team of the NFP takes care of most decisions, just like in a for-profit company. A board might only convene a few times per year, just to check in on the NFPs progress and make sure it is sticking to its commitments. Boards have the duty of approving an NFPs budget and any major changes to the budget and they also play a role in making major decisions that will change the structure of an NFP, such as merging with another NFP or starting a subsidiary company.  Although most countries legislation allows for paid staff members to be on the board, there is also a requirement for a certain percentage of board members to be non-paid and non-staff, in order to maintain a degree of objectivity in decision-making processes. In this regard, there are strict rules about conflicts of interest. Any board member who stands to benefit from a decision must declare their conflict of interest and abstain from voting on the issue at hand. Board members are expected to hold each other accountable for declaring such conflicts of interest. As most NFP board members are volunteering their valuable time for a cause, they tend to take their"

As such, the NFP board means that theres less need for government or outside authorities to act as the conscience of the company or to balance out the self-interest of the owners and managers. Thats not to say that a board is immune to corruption, which well address later, but the requirement to have a mission-driven board is a critical difference between the for-profit and NFP business models, as it adds a layer of accountability. Raising Capital  Since the advent of capitalism, the main way to start or grow a business has been to raise capital from private investors. Investors typically decide whether to invest in a startup business based on how much money they believe theyll get back from it in the form of equity, interest, and dividends. In the business world, this is known as ROI (Return on Investment). This sort of investment is something that the owners and managers of companies can draw on at various stages of the businesss development, depending on their needs for greater financial liquidity or their desire for more personal wealth. If they want to grow, they can raise more capital by approaching more investors with a plan for how they will deliver a high return on investment. 																																																													136	Ibid	How	on	Earth		Working	draft	Hinton	&	Maclurcan	(2016)		49	NFPs cant raise capital in the ways that for-profit businesses traditionally do, and for-profit subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by NFPs cant raise capital in this way either.

This is why raising capital investment has been a massive advantage that for-profits have traditionally had over NFPs. That is, until recently. The landscape of the economy has changed tremendously over the last couple of decades and NFPs no longer face the same barriers they used to in the market.  Only 20 years ago, it would have been quite rare to see businesses starting up as NFPs. However, the Age of Technology has changed everything and NFP startups are on the rise.137 The internet has not only helped level the playing field in terms of capital-raising, but it has also significantly brought down the costs of starting and running a business, which means that NFPs and for-profits alike no longer have to spend huge amounts of money to start and build a successful business.  When planning how to start an NFP, grants, donations, membership fees and volunteers often come to mind. Grants from foundations or government agencies and donations of money, time, and other assets from the community can provide a great financial base on which to build a successful NFP business, as long as there is a plan to generate enough revenue to become financially independent after the startup period.  This is similar to a for-profit business that relies on an initial injection of capital, investment and loans, to get started, but"

In addition to using donations, grants, membership fees and volunteers to start up, many new NFP businesses take loans from banks and private investors. This is a perfectly acceptable way of raising capital in the NFP world, as there is a cap on how much a private investor will get back on his or her loan  a set interest rate. The interest is considered compensation for the time it takes the company to pay back the loan (like a fee) as well as compensation for the loss of the moneys value over time due to inflation (a dollar declines in real purchasing power over time). Interest is best thought of as the price of the loan, and is not a private gain for the lender. Many places even have usury laws that place restrictions on the rate of interest allowed in lending, so that price is not exploitative. In many U.S. states, for instance, it is not legal to give consumer loans with an interest rate of over 10%.138  Loan repayments (including interest) are considered a business expense, since it is a set amount that is calculated and budgeted at the beginning of the year. A dividend cannot be calculated and budgeted at the beginning of the year, as it depends on the amount of profit generated by the companyvi.

Instead of a large financial return on investment, NFPs promise a social return on investment (SROI). This means that investors will benefit in social ways from their investment. Their investment will benefit under-served segments of the community and/or the environment, and thus will benefit everyone in the community, as well as the investors themselves. Although much innovation is happening in the sphere of NFP investing, a certain set of principles apply to all NFP investment and capital-raising:  There can be no private equity (no shares, no stock, no ownership).  No private distribution of profit or assets is allowed.  Repayment of investment must be budgeted for as a business expense, not taken from profits.

The Nonprofit Finance Fund is a veteran in this field and continues to lead the way. Since 1980, they have served thousands of NFPs throughout the U.S., by providing over $700 million in loans and access to other forms of finance such as grants, tax credits and capital, in support of $2.3 billion of projects for thousands of organizations across the nation.142   There is a general trend for NFP businesses to use debt-based capital, whereas for-profits tend to seek equity-based capital. In both forms, the company owes the investor something. In debt-based capital, the business owes the lender the principal amount of the loan or bond until its paid off, and in equity-based capital, the business actually sells a piece of itself for capital investment. We argue that debt-based capital is healthier, because it allows the company to maintain its focus, values and ethics, without having to take new owners or shareholders considerations into account. Debt-based capital is temporary, while equity-based capital is permanent.  The community bond, also known as a social impact bond or social benefit bond, is another powerful debt-based capital-raising instrument for NFPs. Community bonds are a lot like small loansix, but a company gets a lot of these small loans from multiple sources in the community with a low interest rate. A company can sell community bonds to many members of the community for"

Then, over time, the company will pay back the principal amount (the original amount the bond was bought for)  say $500 - plus interest. Community bonds allow a startup business to tap into the support of the community by asking for smaller sums from a large number of people. This contrasts with traditional ways of capital-raising, typically asking for a large sum of money from just a few sources, such as banks or wealthy investors.   Glas Cymru, a NFP company in Wales, used community bonds to buy Welsh Water in 2001. Over a period of 18 months, Glas Cymru raised 1.9 billion in bonds, allowing it to acquire the Welsh Water company from Western Power Distribution, a for-profit corporation. They paid down the bonds in 6 years, providing a small financial return and a big social return to their community investors. Some of the successes of the group to date include:  some 3 billion invested to improve drinking water quality, environmental protection and customer service  at no cost to the taxpayer  150 million returned to customers in the form of customer dividends and some 10 million of support for disadvantaged customer groups via social tariffs and an assistance fund, and  lower average customer bills in real terms than in 2000, in part due to the best record in the sector in cost reduction and improved efficiency.143  Its important to remember that Glas Cymrus investors dont hold equity or shares in the company, as"

A bondholder, like a lender, can be financially compensated for the time theyve lent their money away, via interest payments, but the bondholder cannot gain from the companys profits, where shareholders can with shares. The bondholder is paid from the NFPs budget, not from its profits. The fact that dividends depend on the profit made each year or quarter means there is a speculative aspect to the dividends paid out to shareholders. The same goes for owners with equity in a company, who are hoping that the company will be more valuable every year, so that their personal stake in the company is also worth more. The extreme of this speculative tendency in for-profit capital-raising is venture capital. Venture capital is a form of investment in which an investor or a group invests a sum of money into a company, with the explicit expectation to profit as much from the company as possible in as short amount of time as possible. It can be very risky for both the investor and the investee, as both stand to lose a lot of money.  NFPs have lots of options when it comes to raising capital, including loans, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and community bonds, in addition to more traditional forms of"

Not-for-profit businesses can use any combination of these different strategies to meet their capital needs. As more social innovation continues to happen in order to make capital-raising easier and more accessible to these new businesses, further advances in this area are expected.xi Taxation A business can be NFP in almost any sector, anywhere in the world, but it may or may not get tax exemptions. For instance, only about half of all nonprofits in the U.S. are 501(c)3 certified, the most common kind of tax-exempt status in that country.144 Tax benefits for NFPs come in many forms. They can be exempt from paying corporation taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, and property taxes, depending on a regions tax laws.   Tax exemptions for NFPs can be a tricky thing, depending on local legislation. For instance, in the U.S., if an NFP earns more than 20 percent or so of its revenue from business activities that arent directly related to its stated social purpose, the NFP might lose its tax-exempt status.145   In Canada, an NFP risks losing its tax exemptions if it makes a large amount of profit or accumulates a large sum of money, which the Canada Revenue Agency might interpret as being profit-oriented. Instead, Canadian law states that surplus for NFPs is acceptable if it is unintentional and unanticipated.146   In most cases, even if an organization loses its tax exemptions, it can maintain its legal NFP status, because tax-exemptions are"

Why do NFPs get tax benefits that for-profits dont? And should they really be entitled to these benefits?  These questions have a surprisingly simple answer. Not-for-profit companies reduce the need for taxation in the first place, by fulfilling social needs that the government would otherwise have to fund.  Blue Star Recyclers, for instance, have calculated that they saved the taxpayers $233,353 in 2015 by employing people with disabilities.151 Imagine what would happen to the millions of people who are benefitting from the NFPs we mention throughout this chapter - people struggling with addiction, homelessness, illness, disabilities and financial hardship  if there were no NFPs. Either the whole world would be a lot worse off for it, or taxes"

In this light, it only seems fair that NFP businesses should not have to pay the same taxes as for-profit companies, which aim to financially benefit owners and investors through profit-maximization. In contrast, the wider community benefits from the financial surplus of NFPs. Thus, NFPs very much deserve their financial advantage.  NFP tax exemptions are even more justifiable considering the enormous subsidies and tax cuts without which most for-profits would be unprofitable. Often called corporate welfare, large companies all over the world in the agricultural, banking, finance, shipping and fossil fuel industries receive incredible amounts of government assistance in the form of subsidies and tax breaks.152 Not only do they enjoy tax cuts and subsidies, they also have the resources to seek advice on exploiting loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of tax.  This scenario is not restricted to large for-profit companies. Thirty-four percent of U.S. for-profit banks get a tax advantage through their Subchapter S Status for small businesses.153 The Credit Union National Association estimates that concessions to small for-profit banks resulted in nearly $1 billion of foregone revenue for the U.S. Treasury in 2016, while 																																																													147	Community Enterprise Law website (2018) Nonprofit organizations; Nonprofits without tax exemption section.

In exchange for these tax exemptions, there is a higher expectation for NFPs to disclose how they use their resources. An NFP owes the public documentation of how it used the income that society forgoes the right to tax.155  In addition to tax exemptions, some governments offer NFPs other financial benefits. For example, NFPs in Australia get reductions on the annual business registration fee they have to pay.156 And in the U.S., some states give nonprofit organizations immunity from certain legal liabilities and other states limit NFP liability by enacting a damage cap, so that NFPs arent as vulnerable as for-profits with regards to certain legal issues.157  NFP Enterprises Come in Many Different Forms Creating a distinct category for NFP enterprise might make it seem like a homogenous sector. In reality, there is an incredible amount of variety in the NFP business world. In addition to traditional nonprofits trying to become more self-sufficient, were seeing more people starting businesses and cooperatives as NFPs. Old nonprofit models are shifting and new NFP models are emerging, making for a diverse and exciting new space in the economy.  Not-for-profit businesses around the world meet the needs of hundreds of millions of customers and beneficiaries everyday through the wide variety of goods and services they sell.158"

Cooperatives have a special focus on democratic management by members, but in most places, there is no significant legal difference between mutual business models and cooperative models. Some mutuals and cooperatives are owned by members and distribute profit to members,172 which makes them for-profit. Others are non-distributing and have asset-locks, which makes them NFP. In Australia, for instance, about three-quarters of cooperatives are established as NFPs.173  Although most other countries dont seem to keep official tabs on whether cooperatives are distributing or non-distributing, we feel comfortable saying that its likely that most cooperatives in the world are NFP due to the prominence and proliferation of consumer cooperatives.

The Central Wisconsin Electric Cooperative was established in 1938 by local citizens to bring electricity to rural communities in Wisconsin, and this consumer cooperative puts any and all profit right back into serving those communities. As a cooperative, every member has a say in how the business is managed.174  Another business model in the sphere of consumer cooperatives is the credit unionxv. Credit unions are member-run banks whose mission is to provide financial services to its members. As with all consumer co-ops, dividends, rebates and refunds that members might receive from a credit union at the end of the year never exceed the amount of money that the members have put into the credit union. Credit unions have experienced an impressive rise in popularity in recent years, especially in the U.S. where membership growth rates have been higher every year since 2010.175 In 2015, the U.S. had a total of 104 million credit union members, which is nearly 1/3 of the entire American population, according to the United States Census.176 This is probably because customers usually get better deals from credit unions than from mainstream banks, which is especially true for lower income members.177 Banks collect 2.5 times more in fees from low-balance checking accounts annually ($218 on average) than on high-balance accounts ($90 on average), while credit unions collect an average of $80 on low-balance accounts and $42 on high-balance"

The ownership is set up in a way that benefits the entire community, not just a few privileged people. Community ownership models are being innovated in a wide variety of sectors.  Community-owned renewable energy is one of the most exciting of these innovations. Denmark was a pioneer in this field, with many of its numerous community wind projects dating back to the 1980s.193 The way it works is that a community pools its resources in order to make the capital investment of buying the wind turbines, which will then pay for themselves by providing free energy within 7-10 years after installation. After those 7-10 years, the community just sits back and benefits from clean, renewable, cost-free energy. Some communities even make money from selling their surplus energy into a national or regional grid, with any profit made by the community used to benefit the community.194  Community ownership can take many different forms. In the case of wind turbines, for example, the municipality or city can own them, or a new NFP corporation can be formed to represent the communitys ownership (like community-based enterprises in the U.K.). Or a NFP cooperative can be formed, to ensure democratic control of the turbines, as is the case with many of Denmarks community wind installations. In any case, the ownership is purpose-driven and does"

Often, community ownership is a response to privatization in a certain sector. When people feel that a basic need is not being met adequately due to private ownership, a natural reaction is to communitize that product or service. Next Century Cities is an initiative dedicated to spreading community-owned broadband throughout the U.S., city by city. In the face of restricted access to the Internet due to the rising prices of major for-profit broadband providers, the people who created Next Century Cities decided enough was enough; that the Internet has become too essential for both work and daily life for people not to have.

The idea of community forests has taken off in Latin America in recent years and a lot of innovation has taken place there. Some community forests have set up multiple subsidiary enterprises based on the forest, like businesses that provide timber, water, tourism, and non-timber forest products. Some of these enterprises are not profitable (they may even operate at a loss), but communities float profits from one business to others in order to make them all work. Its like a supportive web of businesses. For these communities, the enterprises are important not because they make profits per se, but because they generate local employment, so people from the community do not need to go to the city in search of work. For instance, in a community forest in Ixtlan de Juarez, Mexico, the most profitable business has been in timber and the other businesses, like water and tourism don't generate as much money, but that doesnt matter to the community, as profit isn't their main goal. Similar community forest models have been observed in The Gambia as well as First Nations communities in Quebec.198  Government-Owned Corporations Government-ownership is basically just community-ownership on a larger scale. And sometimes they can be the same thing, as is the case with municipalities owning wind turbines. From the local through to the national and federal levels, government-owned corporations can also be considered NFP businesses, as all profits must be reinvested into government missions, which are meant to serve society.

Landscape of All Business Models Companies with common for-profit legal status can also act like NFPs, cycling all of their profits back into social or environmental missions. A for-profit Limited Liability Company can create clauses in its by-laws or statutes that state: a) the social or environmental mission of the company, and b) that the company will never privately distribute its profits or assets, but instead use all surplus to achieve its mission. This means that even in places that dont have legal infrastructure that supports NFP business, for-profit companies can act like NFPs and join the growing momentum behind a purpose-driven economy. Whats in a Name? From what we have said so far about NFPs, it might seem easy to distinguish an NFP from a for-profit entity - we thought it was when we started working on this book.

As NFPs move into business, things can get kind of blurry. For instance, Harvard University, which is an NFP business, is often described as a private university. But what does private mean? This word conjures up all kinds of different understandings. Many take it to mean privately-owned by individuals, but as we know, NFPs cannot be privately-owned. Taken at face value, it may seem that Harvard is a for-profit university. But it is not. Are they just trying to make it seem more like a business than a traditional nonprofit? Maybe. But the most likely reason they use the word private is to distinguish Harvard from public universities. In the U.S., universities are usually categorized as being either public or private. Private is taken to mean not state-owned. There is no real third term for independent, not-for-profit universities like Harvard. Yet this growing trend means that NFP enterprises should start collectively carving out their own distinct space in all sectors. In the case of American universities, it would be a lot clearer if we begin to categorize universities as NFP, public, or for-profit; rather than just private or public. Many NFP co-ops also use for-profit language, perhaps without realizing it. An NFP co-op is not technically owned by the members, as many U.S. credit unions and consumer co-ops claim to be.

A shareholder owns a portion of a company, and seeks to make financial gains from the part of the company he or she owns in the form of a dividend payout from the profits every year. Since no one can own an NFP and an NFP cannot privately distribute profit, the words owner and shareholder have no place in the description of NFP co-ops.  Likewise, an NFP co-op might refer to a required founding share for a nominal amount, but there is no title, equity, trade-ability or transferability of shares and, the ownership is therefore, not-for-profit.  In simple terms, no one can own a share of an NFP, except for another NFP. Using the word share in the context of an NFP co-op is purely symbolic and can actually do more harm than good, making people think the co-op is for-profit. The inaccurate use of these words can be confusing and misleading. Many NFP co-ops also say that their members receive dividends. We have found this to be the case for quite a few NFP credit unions and energy co-ops, which at first made us doubt whether they were really NFP. Yet these dividends are really just refunds or rebates that the co-ops give back to their customers at the end of the year. No one receiving dividends from an NFP is making a financial gain from them. The same is true for patronage dividends and capital credits."

It makes the refund sound speculative when it is not. Sometimes interest on loans is even referred to as equity by NFPs. But again, as no one can own an NFP, no one can have equity in it. Equity is another one of these for-profit terms that implies private ownership and How	on	Earth		Working	draft	Hinton	&	Maclurcan	(2016)		67	even speculation. Interest on loans that a company pays to its lenders is very different from equity-based dividends that only for-profit companies can distribute.

For example, Community Interest Companies in the UK are often thought of by the public as NFP entities, but there are in fact both for-profit and not-for-profit CICs. Community Interest Companies limited by share, as their name implies, do sell shares in the company and can privately distribute up to 30% of the profits. However, the vast majority of incorporated CICs are not-for-profit (the limited by guarantee form)204 because the entrepreneurs behind these companies see it as a model that better aligns with their purpose and vision. Thus, the NFP entrepreneur represents a new livelihood for the 21st century. Likewise, the benefit corporation model in the U.S., which is only for-profit, sounds like it is NFP. In fact, many people have asked us why we dont use the term for-benefit corporation instead of NFP, as it sounds so much more positive, and seemingly defines the company by what it is, rather than what it is not. The misleading nature of the for-profit benefit corporation name is the reason. It goes to show how many different interpretations the words benefit or purpose can have, whereas not-for-profit has a very specific legal interpretation that is nearly universal throughout the world, and has been tried and tested over 200 years. In fact, we strongly feel that what the world needs right now is exactly not-for-profit business. Many people also assume that all social enterprise models and all social cooperative models are NFP.

Kurt asked, What could that possibly be?  Joe answered, Enough. The Common Roots of the Crises Before exploring how the Not-for-Profit World model can work, we need to have a deeper understanding of how and why the for-profit world in which we currently live isnt working well.   When we look a bit deeper, we find that the worsening social, economic and environmental conditions of the 21st century are symptoms of a deeper crisis of purpose and perception in Western culture.224 This crisis manifests in our for-profit economic system and its fundamental assumptions. The For-Profit Story Stories create the world in which we live. The manmade world around us is a manifestation of a story. The world is manifested and shaped according to our views and beliefs. And those views and beliefs are really just the stories weve inherited and tweaked to explain why the world is the way it is.225 For instance, the idea that progress means moving forward in time is a story; a belief. Historians and anthropologists have found that many indigenous cultures, including most Native American cultures, view time as cyclical, not linear, because they built their societies according to the natural cycles of the moon, the sun and the seasons.226 They share a collective story that says time is a cycle that continuously moves around and around. This is very different from the Western civilizations story about time. In the Western world, we assume everything must constantly be developing, progressing, and moving forward over"

A paradigm can be thought of as the main guiding story of a society. Before Copernicus and Galileo, European society organized around the story that the Earth was the center of the universe. After Galileos telescopic discovery, society began to organize around the story that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun  that we are part of a heliocentric solar system.  Many scholars argue that it is the very ability to share stories that separates us from other species.228 This ability has allowed us to create complex forms of social organization. The capacity to transmit stories, to describe the world around us, to talk about ideas and visions for the future, has enabled us to organize into very large groups to work towards common goals. Only by having shared goals, and a shared story, can we cooperate flexibly in very large numbers.229  There are all kinds of stories that shape society today  stories about what it is to be human, about how women and men should behave, and how society should be organized. These stories"

Just as with any social system, the for-profit economy in which we live is underpinned by a certain set of assumptions, beliefs, and worldviews. Business is based on shared stories about the economy - a common economic myth.230 What is the overarching story around which we organize our businesses and the economy? What narrative keeps our current economic system going?  Even people who have never taken a single economics course know this story, because most of us have internalized the narrative of the for-profit system. These are some of the fundamental beliefs of modern Western civilization and so we learn them as children, through our schooling, from our parents, and even from fairytales, comic books, cartoons, and video games. Were exposed to this story daily through the news, TV shows, films, magazines, and advertisements. In short, the story goes something like this:  Evolution is a process of different organisms competing for scarce resources. Thus, evolution is driven by competition and survival of the fittest. Thats why human nature is mostly selfish, greedy and competitive and people are primarily motivated by their ability to profit; to make a personal gain. In light of the fierce competition of evolution, it is only rational to always be looking out for your own self-interest and trying to maximize your individual gain. Not only are we are all separate individuals who compete with each"

Without the threat of poverty, most people would be too lazy to do anything and they would just try to leach off the few naturally hard-working, productive people in society. This is because we all seek to maximize pleasure and rewards and minimize effort and pain. Without inequality to motivate us to work, the economy would fail, civilization would descend into chaos and most of us would suffer greatly.  Progress also requires inequality, because inequality motivates people to move up the ladder of competition that leads from one social stratum to the next. The economic winners are those who accumulate the most because they are the most clever, competitive, rational, hard-working people.

When this story was first being developed by the early modern economists and philosophers, it was a story of freedom and prosperity.

The for-profit market delivered on many of its advocates promises (depending on what gender, race and nationality you were). However, we always need to remember the importance of context. Firstly, it must be acknowledged that the wealth accumulated by early capitalists and the rise of a middle class in the first industrial countries was only made possible by slave labor, worker exploitation, colonialism and the genocide of indigenous populations and appropriation of their lands. When resources and labor are virtually free, its quite easy to produce affordable goods and services - and to get rich doing so.  Aside from the moral failures that enabled the emergence of capitalism, there is also the wider historical context. In a world in which there was no middle class, only an aristocracy and peasants, the capitalist system worked wonders. In a context in which average people had very little choice or freedom in the way they could live their lives, the for-profit story empowered many of them to work hard, start up their own businesses and contribute to their communities by providing goods and services that were never before available. Before the Industrial Revolution kicked into full gear, resources were plentiful, production was low, and consumption was minimal. The market was wide-open and there was enough room for everybody to participate in growing the economy at an unprecedented rate. In a context in which the sky was the limit to the expansion of the market, the for-profit system worked miracles for many.  However, this"

The for-profit story supports the capitalist economy and vice versa. This means that we cannot have truly systemic change without also reshaping the underlying stories that support and validate the system. The most obvious way in which the for-profit story and economic behavior mutually reinforce each other is through the profit motive; the notion that economic behavior is the result of individuals seeking to accumulate as much financial wealth as possible. This manifests in capitalists investing in whatever will give them the highest return on investment. It can be seen in the job market, with job-seekers looking for jobs with the highest salaries. It also plays a role for some employers, who will try to pay employees as little as possible without losing them altogether.

Although the term was not used until the 19th century, it has its roots in the earliest modern economic theories.237   In 1776, Adam Smith, the father of capitalism wrote, ""It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.""238   In an 1836 essay, early economist John Stuart Mill described man as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained.239   This notion that people base their decisions and behavior on personal gain is pervasive in society. It implies that if you are smart, then you will look at how you can gain as much money as possible (as in the case of investors, shareholders and employees) or how you can lose the least money possible (as in the case of employers and consumers). Paying more than the lowest possible price for something is considered foolish behavior. Yet, if you are a seller, not getting paid the highest possible price for a good is considered equally foolish and even weak. Thats the profit motive at work. Thats the engine of our economy.

Is it reasonable to hold as a common belief that the smartest people in society are those who take the most for themselves? That the most intelligent are the greediest? What does that say about generous people?  On closer inspection, it becomes very clear that when private gain is the primary source of motivation in the economy, people tend to make very selfish decisions that may provide a financial gain for them, but at a cost to the wider community. Take the example of an oil drilling company that, in order to save money, doesnt update its safety measures, risking the lives of its employees as well as the health of the natural environment in which the company is drilling. Or think of a car manufacturer that lies about its cars emissions in order to boost sales and maximize profit.  The profit motive also sets the stage for very unhealthy norms in corporate culture. In publicly-listed companies (i.e.  companies traded on the stock exchange), CEO compensation often depends on share price rather than any other indicators of performance. This detaches performance from real world value creation. In other words, a financial company can be trading toxic financial instruments that harm its own customers, not to mention undermine the entire economy, but if it raises share prices in the next quarterxxi, the CEO will be handsomely rewarded. 																																																													237	(Ref:	Investopedia	(primary	source?))	238	(Ref:	Smith,	Adam.

Although its easy to point fingers and declare these actions unethical, and label these people a few bad apples, this sort of behavior is actually just the rational thing for business managers to do, according to the for-profit story. It naturally flows from the for-profit worldview. If we want systemic change, we need to take a deeper look at the rules of the game, and not get caught up on blaming the individual players. Perhaps people like Fuld are greedy sociopaths, but its not a coincidence that theyre the winners of our economic game. The profit motive was guiding them 100% of the way. They are the epitome of rational economic actors being motivated by the accumulation of private profit and self-interest. Indeed, they are playing by the rules of capitalism very well.

Its hard not to when domination and accumulation are the goals of the game.  Its self-contradictory to encourage the Golden Rule - do unto others as you would have them do unto you - but only within the larger framework of the profit motive. This is a recipe for inner conflict, because you can't expect a society built on individual gain to function for the common good. This hypocrisy is particularly evident when business people that play by the rules of for-profit business are praised and envied for their financial success, but at the same time scorned for being greedy and selfish. How can we rationalize the idea that we all should want more material wealth, but we shouldnt harm others by our greed and selfishness?  There is a larger cultural crisis lurking beneath the economic crisis. Its a crisis of the values we hold and the stories we tell.

And when deals do go through, there are often sore feelings or doubts afterwards about not having gotten enough money or having paid too much. Whatever the results, this way of thinking about economic transactions does little to build real trust in society and can do a lot to tear relationships apart.

This is an inevitable consequence of the for-profit system. Capitalism has always contained the seeds of its own demise  it just had to run its course before this became evidentxxii. The wealth extraction siphon works by taking wealth out of the real economy and putting it into the elite economy. The wealthiest people in American society gain 47% of their income from the real economy via wages and salaries (16%), business income (17%), and interest and dividend payments (14.1%).243 Trickle-down theory proposes that the wealth will trickle down to lower-income households from this elite group, as they spend money back into the real economy, fueling the wealth circulation pump.

Eighteen percent of super-rich income is invested in real estate,246 much of which is spent on luxury property, which just moves money from the hands of one super-rich owner to another, keeping the wealth in the elite economy.  It can be argued that even when the super-rich buy property in order to rent it out in the real economy, they are actually priming the wealth extraction siphon even more, because they will be receiving rent from tenants who work in the real economy and they will put most of the payments they receive into the elite economy. So their investments in real estate are more likely to strengthen the siphon than to strengthen the pump. The other 27% of their wealth is kept in cash and bank deposits, some of which is spent into the real economy.247 Many of their purchases, like $20,000 handbags, multi-million dollar yachts and vacations on private islands, keep wealth in the elite economy.

In order to gain a better understanding of current economic trends, economist Thomas Piketty painstakingly analyzed massive amounts of historical tax return data. In his book, Capital in the 21st Century, he describes that capitalism has an inherent tendency to increase inequality because returns on capital exceed the rate of economic growth and so any economic growth benefits only those at the top.274 Piketty also notes from his data that we have entered an indefinite era in which returns are (and will continue to be) higher than the rate of economic growth. This means massive inequality is written into the very fabric of capitalism in the 21st century.

Some might argue that the for-profit system does not require growth because businesses can compensate for their profits being privately distributed by reducing costs. In essence, they lower their expenditures, rather than expand, to maintain or increase their profit margins while staying the same size. Aside from the ethical issues that are often part and parcel of strategies to reduce costs (like moving factories abroad in order to exploit cheap labor and take advantage of lax environmental and labor laws), costs can only come down so far; its not a viable strategy in the long-term. The for-profit system requires growth. And this brings us to another crisis of capitalism: growth at all costs. Money Creation Another symptom of this economic systems self-destructive tendencies that is closely tied to inequality and concentration of wealth and power is debt. Growing inequality is driving more people to take out more debt, which puts poorer people in an even more difficult financial position and it puts the wealthy people who benefit from debt in an even more advantageous financial position. In essence, the modern banking system itself is built on debt, which, in the hands of for-profit banks, acts as a siphon that sucks wealth from the poorest to the richest people in society. Usury in the for-profit economy is leading this system to its own destruction. In the for-profit economy, fractional reserve banking means that banks can create money out"

And, of course, the whole system promotes consumers to take on more debt for the sake of consumption, in the name of economic growth and profit maximization. In fact, debt is so ubiquitous, that its estimated that 35-40% of the costs of any product are actually interest on debt.276 Thanks to the exponential growth of compounding interest, world debt is at US $199 trillion, having risen by $57 trillion since 2007.277  Fractional reserve banking refers to the common practice of banks only being required to keep a fraction of the loans they make in their reserves. So, as a hypothetical, if the fractional reserve rate in Australia is 5%, an Australian bank that loans out $100, only has to actually have 5 of those dollars in its reserves. It effectively creates the other 95 dollars when it makes the loan. Then when the $100 is paid back by the borrower, the slate is wiped clean and the 95 dollars ($100 minus the reserve amount of $5) that were created no longer exist.

Advocates for ending the fractional reserve system argue that more debt-based money must be loaned into the system in order for that extra $7 to be paid back to the bank because that extra money doesnt exist in the system278. So, interest on debt requires more debt to be created, which requires more debt to be created in order to pay off that new debt, in an infinite spiral of growing debt and interest. This means that there will always be more debt in the system than there is money to pay back the debt, which puts pressure on banks and borrowers to continuously keep growing the money supply through creating more debt.  So profit-maximization is the goal that drives the system of money creation through debt. The compound interest is piling up and must get paid down by borrowers. Banks that pay out dividends and give returns to owners and shareholders need that interest to be paid down in order to deliver it to the people at the top.  This is largely motivated by the desire to make the bank owners and shareholders even richer, the sign of a successful for-profit company. However, the bank owners and shareholders gaining from the interest paid on loans contributes to worsening inequality in society, as the wealthy gain from the interest payments of people in the working class.

The more people go into debt, the more the wealthy stand to gain.   Money creation by for-profit banks in the for-profit system creates a situation of scarcity, because much of the interest being repaid by borrowers is distributed to bank owners and shareholders and is, thus, siphoned up into the elite economy. This means theres less liquidity in the system (basically less money in the system), so there is a necessity to keep loaning more and more money into existence in order to keep the economy going and growing. In fact, this debt-based money in the for-profit context is another form of pressure on the economy to grow, because all of the interest extracted must be compensated for somehow  it must be loaned into existence.

An assembly line could put together dozens of fans in the same time it would take you to put one fan together at your house. If you produce 500,000 fans at your factory next year, each fan will cost even less to make. This is called economies of scale.  Companies that make cheaper products generally outcompete their peers who sell the same products at higher prices, so economies of scale have enabled large companies to outcompete smaller producers in many industries.  Mass production isnt the only way that companies have reduced costs, though. Survival of the fittest in the past few decades has meant that, in many sectors, only the producers who moved to countries where labor is cheap, safety standards are lax, and environmental damage doesnt cost anything can prosper or even survive. Manufacturers who dont move abroad have higher costs and cant compete.

But thats not a concern for most manufacturers. Poor quality is a positive thing for them, because it means that people will have to buy a new fan sooner rather than later, which means that sales and profits will rise. The competition to produce the highest-quality products has given way to the competition to produce the cheapest products. Why? This comes back to the Homo economicus consumer, always looking to be clever and save a buck in the short-term. (Of course, in light of current levels of inequality, this also has to do with the fact that most consumers simply have less money to spend.)  We can see the trend to produce cheaper, lower quality products in almost every manufacturing sector, from electronics and toys to clothes and shoes. Its even reached the point where food products, medical equipment, and construction materials - where wed hope quality would always be the highest priority - increasingly come from unregulated factories overseas283 and are cause for serious health and safety concerns.  This race to the bottom has co-evolved with a phenomenon called planned obsolescence. This is when companies intentionally design products to break or become obsolete before their time, in order to keep consumption up and boost profits.   The 2010 documentary about planned obsolescence, The Light Bulb Conspiracy, features many examples of this phenomenon. It starts with a printer that stops working. The printers owner, Marcos, takes it to a few different repair shops,"

The end of the film reveals that the printer was programmed to stop printing after 1000 prints and Marcos was able to get it started again by simply resetting the counter to 0. This story probably resonates with most of us very well. Living in the 21st century, the line, You might as well get a new (insert name of object here). Repairing it will cost more than buying a new one, has almost become a mantra. Communications technology is one sector that is basically designed for planned obsolescence. Companies could give us the most current version of the mobile phone, tablet, or computer theyve developed, but we wont see the latest version for several years. Instead, they offer us a slightly different version every year, in order to make last years version seem obsolete and spur consumers to buy the latest adaptation. This doesnt only work on consumers who are concerned about keeping up with the latest trends and looking up-to-date. Technology companies create less-than-optimal software for their products on purpose, so that next years edition can resolve the issues they intentionally created in this years edition and the consumer can look forward to having a better experience each year as long as they can afford to buy a new phone or tablet every year.284  																																																													282	(Ref:	Poorly	Made	in	China	by	Paul	Midler)	283	Ref:	Ibid?,	Global	Supply	Chain	Quality	Management?	284	(Ref:	Sustainable	Electronics	article?;	Bodies	of	Planned	Obsolescence?;	Environmental	Impacts	of	Planned	Obscolencence?)

Many large companies generate a surplus by exploiting workers, destroying ecosystems, and selling low-quality products that break-down soon after theyre purchased, mostly in order to generate profits for owners and investors and to increase their share price. Large numbers of people are being taken advantage of in order to line a few individuals pockets.  In capitalism, markets are supposed to efficiently assign prices to goods and services through negotiations between buyers and sellers based on the information they have. However, in the for-profit world, its often in the sellers self-interest to manipulate or withhold information related to their products. This keeps costs low, but means consumers have imperfect information when it comes to their choices. Consequently, prices do not reflect the actual cost of goods and services, especially in terms of negative effects on ecosystems and human health.  Many clothing companies in high-income countries produce their clothes in factories in low-income countries with very unsafe, unfair and unhealthy working conditions. In some of these factories (also known as sweatshops), workers are essentially modern-day slaves. The companies do this so that they can sell clothes at cheap prices and make large profits.

The latter are cultures that value cooperation and equality. They honor and uphold those who give and contribute to the wider community. In contrast, the dominator cultures uphold those who are most effective at conquering and controlling others. Accordingly, dominator cultures tend to be unequal and violent. Somebody has to be at the top and somebody has to be at the bottom.287  Eisler argues that for at least 30,000 years of human existence, partnership cultures were the norm, but at around 5000 BCE, dominator cultures arose quite rapidly and conquered the partnership communities. And we have been living in a dominator world ever since. The worldview of only the strong survive justifies and encourages the domination of enemies and the weak. In the dominator mindset, the way we know when someone or something is weak is when we have been able to conquer it, just like the European conquerors who went all over the world, subjugating indigenous people in Australia, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas. Did the conquerors feel bad for the people they slaughtered or enslaved? According to the dominator worldview, the weak will inevitably be conquered because it is simply natures way. This way of organizing society naturally leads to the concentration of power in the hands of the top dominators. Eisler illustrated that the same dominator model of politics and the"

Indeed, the quest of the Scientific Revolution, which started in Europe in the 1400s, was to conquer nature. Many famous figures of the time, like Descartes, talked about taking nature apart in order to understand and manipulate it. Scientist and philosopher Francis Bacon, in an extreme example, even talked about torturing nature to make her reveal her secrets,288 and its no coincidence that he used the word her. Eisler explains that anything seen as caring, giving or nurturing is seen as weak by the dominator mindset and so it has to be controlled. As women are the givers and nurturers of society, because they give birth, breastfeed and take care of small children, they have been identified as weak in dominator cultures and are thus oppressed.289 However, the oppression is not limited to women. Men who are perceived as caring or nurturing or otherwise weak are also oppressed.  Part of the drive to dominate is based on the quest to be the all-powerful leader, but perhaps a more significant part of the dominator drive is based in fear of being dominated, which has translated into a fear of the other; a fear of the unknown and of not having control. This manifests in sexism, racism, xenophobia, genocide, religious oppression, abuse, and bullying. One of the core principles of the for-profit world has been if you can dominate some other,"

The for-profit culture values the act of taking over the act of giving. This is why it has led to an economy of fear and scarcity. In many ways, its a self-fulfilling prophecy. Capitalism also puts high value on the parts of the economy that dominate, conquer and expand. It doesnt put much value on the parts of the economy that nurture and conserve. The caring economy and womens work are simply not valued in the for-profit world, not only in a cultural sense, but also in a financial sense.290 Daycare workers, teachers and nurses are often undervalued for the services they provide in fulfilling basic social needs. People who work or invest in sectors that are based on extracting as much value as quickly as possible and then moving on to the next project (i.e., sectors like drilling, mining, construction, manufacturing, advertising, marketing, gambling, arms trading, finance and banking) are those who make the most money in the world.

Mining and drilling companies can charge whatever it takes to outcompete the other mining and drilling companies and keep large orders coming in. Likewise, the enforcement of a minimum wage is questionable in China, where the fan was probably assembled, and workers rights are sub-standard and often overlooked, making labor as cheap as factory owners want it to be.

The growth imperative of the for-profit world fuels the idea that everything should be a commodity. After all, markets do get saturated and if there were a limit on the number and size of markets, growth would end as soon as everyone had all the houses, TVs, and cars they can handle, and capitalists would no longer be able to maximize their profits. However, as all good economic and business students know, all you have to do to expand the market is create a new niche. There are two ways of doing this: pursuade or force people to start paying for something they werent previously paying for; or manufacture a new need.  In the case of the first strategy, Charles Eisenstein provides an excellent expos of the many ways that the market has taken over more and more of our lives. He points out that"

This has been replaced to a large extent by stories that we pay to read or watch in best-selling books and blockbuster movies. Childcare used to be done by parents, family members and neighbors, free of charge.  Now we routinely drop our children off at daycares, where we pay strangers to care for them. This trend of paying for things that we wouldnt have imagined paying for just a generation or two ago might be fine in some areas of life, but it becomes absurd with the advent of professional cuddlers and friends for hire (both of which truly exist).292  Looking back through history, we can see that this is the latest stage of an ongoing enclosure of the commons. For most of history, the fields of England had been regarded as communal property and were left open for all to use, but in the 1400s the Parliament began to close the land off to the public with fences so that landlords could use them for private benefit.293 The landlords wanted to be able to farm more efficiently rather than having to worry about the communitys crop rotation schedule,"

The documentary describes the overproduction worries after the end of World War I.

Until then, companies had advertised their goods based on their usefulness, like the men who described the virtues of the pen and how it could be used.

This means its in their interest to have a lot of crime and violence in society, and to encourage the criminalization of more and more acts. As a result, the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world312 and the vast majority of prison inmates are serving time for drug offenses (a large portion of which are marijuana-related).313 Many for-profit prisons have even tried to set up deals with local justice systems to create some"

In the mid-1990s, the Eurozone leaders put pressure on for-profit banks to be more competitive with banks in the U.S. and the U.K. As a result, for-profit German and French banks offered low interest loans to governments in countries where the money was needed, mostly in southern Europe.

Ecosystems would go into rapid decline and human systems would begin to collapse as a result. This process of collapse would entail food shortages, fresh water shortages, disease and political instability (Ref: Ibid). At the time of its publishing, the Limits to Growth report was met with a mixed reception. A nascent environmental movement embraced its findings, while many economists and politicians dismissed them as ludicrous, stating that human ingenuity will always find ways around natural limits. However, since the study was published, scientists have been keeping a close eye on the various indicators that were used in the model and The Club of Romes standard track is right on the mark for the years 1970 - 2000.325 This scenario predicts a global collapse of ecosystems by 2050.

Hubbert calculated that at some point in the early 21st century, we would reach the point at which half of the worlds natural petroleum reserves had been used; its called peak oil because it takes the shape of a mountain peak on the charts.329 He looked at the examples of Ohio and Illinois to explain the principle of peak oil.

This might not sound too alarming at first glance, but oil is absolutely integral to keeping our modern society going. Over 400 gallons of oil are used to feed each American every year.333 This is due to our globalized industrial food system in which agriculture has become highly mechanized and food is frequently imported from far away. All that transportation, not to mention the fuel required by the machines and fertilizers used to produce and process the food, requires a lot of oil. Some analysts believe that we have already reached the peak and that, in the coming decades, remaining oil will become so difficult to access that it will be prohibitively expensive.334 World discoveries of new oil fields peaked in the 1960s and the discoveries since then have been smaller and further offshore, so its easy to imagine a corresponding peak in production in the near future.335 This is particularly scary, as based on current rates of consumption, its estimated that in the next 20 years, well consume"

The more the human consumption expands, the more habitats it destroys in the process. Indeed, human population growth is an important contributing factor to the Sixth Mass Extinction and is causing us to use up the Earths resources even faster.

At the beginning of 2016, we started with 7.3 billion people on the planet, which means that the population will grow by roughly 73 million people this year.370  But in 2025, we will have an estimated global population of 8.1 billion,371 which means that, if the rate of growth is still 1%, the population will increase by 81 million people. Thats ten million more people being added per year than in 2016, but its still 1% of the population. One percent doesnt sound like much, and thats why it can be deceiving.

When 40 percent of all pregnancies in the world are unwanted or unintended, the importance of womens control over their own reproductivity cannot be understated, especially not in the context of overpopulation.373 It must also be mentioned that an average child in the U.S. will cause 13 times as much environmental damage throughout their life as an average child in Brazil.374 So, any serious discussion of overpopulation and resources must also take into consideration economic and political domination and the resulting inequitable distribution of wealth and opportunities.

More people mean more markets and more consumption, which is good for the bottom line (in the short-term at least).

The former leader of the U.K.s Sustainable Development Commission and author of Prosperity Without Growth, Tim Jackson, makes it clear that the levels of innovation that would enable an absolute decoupling of economic growth from ecological destruction are totally unrealistic.376 In the case of carbon dioxide emissions alone, Jackson calculated that we would need a decrease of carbon dioxide emissions by 11% per year to reach our reduction goals by 2050, which requires a rate of innovation 16 times faster than all of the innovation weve had since 1990 combined.377 As economist Sir Nicholas Stern points out, ""It is difficult to secure emission cuts faster than about 1% per year except in instances of recession.""378 And thats focusing on carbon emissions, without taking into account other forms of pollution and usage of nonrenewable resources. This argument has been proven true, as global GDP grew by 44% between 2004 and 2014, and the consumption of fossil fuels increased by 19%, resulting in a 22% increase in global carbon dioxide emissions, all while governments and businesses were"

It is often claimed that the emerging service economy in the worlds largest cities is resulting in de-carbonization. On the surface of things, this may seem true, but the service economy usually includes the financial sector, which is largely the elite economy, and the growth of the elite economy requires the growth of the real economy of goods and services, in order to compensate for the wealth siphoned away. Furthermore, the claim that electronic services are naturally more eco-friendly than paper-and-pen services is not as cut-and-clear as it may seem. The worlds information-communications technology systems, for instance, use 10% of global electricity generation every year, so going online does not necessarily mean going green.381 In fact, the global IT industry contributes about the same amount of carbon dioxide emissions as the global aviation industry.382 Similarly, we hear numbers about the decreasing carbon footprint of entire nations that continue to grow their GDP.

Within the growth paradigm, gains in efficiency will never be enough. Growth and the drive to maximize profits will always cancel out whatever efficiency we have gained.  But the more important question is: Why should we try so hard to maintain this growth-based economic system when its not making us any happier, its creating unacceptable levels of inequality and its eroding the ecological stability of the planet?  Economic Instability Ecological instability is intricately connected to the economic instability of the for-profit system. The story of palm oil illustrates these connections very well. Ancient forests in some of the worlds most precious biodiversity hotspots in Indonesia are being cut down in order to cultivate palm oil, a very versatile oil that is increasingly added to a wide range of products including lipsticks, cookies, shampoos, instant noodles, and detergents.392 Palm oil is even used as a biofuel.393 In clearing the forests to plant trees for palm oil, a great many species habitats are destroyed."

In the end, the business owners and investors make a lot of money, workers are paid very little and indigenous populations are left landless, contributing to even more inequality.

Their larger size gives them an even greater advantage over small, local companies, as they can offer lower prices and advertise more extensively. The result is that more people buy from the large, transnational corporations, which gives them the ability to expand even more. This is precisely the trend that has led to the phenomenon weve seen over the last few decades of small, local businesses dying out at an increasing rate and large mega-corporations taking over the market. Many other analysts have pointed this out before, but it is essential to understand that this is the nature of the for-profit economy. Expansion and concentration are inevitable in this system.

What many small businesses do offer is a more personalized experience in both product and service, alongside the fact that your money is much more likely to stay in the local economy, benefitting the local community.401 Yet, these benefits do not align with the values of for-profit consumers. Its just not seen as rational to pay more for products (even if it means purchasing from your neighbor), when youre supposed to focus on low prices, as mandated by Homo economicus.

The trading of stocks is about the possibility of a gain for the investor, whether via dividends or capital gains (from selling the share for more than you bought it for).

Until the U.S. Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) of 2000, derivatives were mostly used to hedge a companys financial risk (Ref: Ibid). This means that a derivative was just a way for a company to share the risk of either losing or gaining money in the future. For instance, an American company that does business in Europe might make a contract with a bank to lock in a certain exchange rate for Euros to U.S. dollars for a year.  This means that the bank will gain or lose money if the exchange rate goes wild, rather than the company.

Each step in the evolution of financial instruments has taken this financial trading further away from real economic activity, allowing traders to gamble in the elite economy to their hearts delight with higher risks - because the value of derivatives fluctuates wildly, they can win big or lose big. Because some financial instruments are so distant from real economic activity, it encourages traders to do irresponsible things that they probably wouldnt do if they had to deal with the actual people whose lives theyre betting on - like the mortgage holders who lost their homes in 2008.

When banks pull back, liquidity in the system dries up and the economy grinds to a halt, which can be really painful for the people in the real economy who dont have extra money laying around, but rather require steady wages from the companies that are now downsizing to pay off their loans that are being called in. The effect of this on ordinary people includes loss of livelihoods, inability to afford medical care, and loss of homes when they are foreclosed on. This is where the global economy is at now - an era in which we can expect to see bursting asset bubbles, credit crunches, and liquidity crises with increasing regularity, as trust in the system continues to erode, and as the social and environmental upheaval the system is generating feeds back in, causing further instability.

At one extreme of the spectrum is free market capitalism, with the government playing a minimal role, while at the other extreme is state socialism, with the government controlling most economic activity.424 As with any spectrum, there are also a variety of mixes of state and market along the spectrum. The majority of critical economic decisions have traditionally revolved around what the optimal mix of market freedom and state control is, in terms of balancing productivity and efficiency with meeting the needs of the wider population.425 State-Driven Responses The state-driven side of the economic spectrum advocates for a greater role of the government in regulating the market, and increasing taxation in order to address issues of inequality and environmental damage caused by a market thats a bit too free.  For instance, after thoroughly analyzing the dynamics of wealth inequality and economic growth, Thomas Pickettys solutions focus on raising tax rates for the wealthiest slices of society. Whilst tax systems vary widely with regards to whom, how much, and what they tax, one of the main aims of taxation around the world is to fund governments provision of essential services and safety nets for the most vulnerable people in society, and balance out wealth inequality. This is why taxation seems like a natural solution to inequality.  Although taxation is an essential part of keeping any modern society functioning, even the most progressive taxation, functioning in the most philanthropic society, cant counteract"

In order to do so, tax rates would have to be so high that there would no longer be an incentive to start or invest in a business and make money. Starting a business wouldnt be worth the risk, given the limitations placed on a potential return on investment, so the market would stall. High tax rates are fundamentally at odds with the profit motive that guides capitalists and for-profit corporations.  Seeking to resolve inequality by means of taxation also belies an acceptance that the economy should inherently create such negative outcomes, as if theyre a natural part of the economy and the best we can do is mitigate these unavoidable effects.  Not only does taxation not get to the root of the problem, seeming to accept the idea that an economy has to be socially and ecologically destructive, but it also just cant happen in the current context.

Only 10% of Federal 2014 tax revenue in the U.S. came from corporations.427 In the U.K., corporate taxes accounted for only 7.5% of total tax revenue in 2014.428 And in Sweden, widely acknowledged as one of the most socialist countries in the world, corporate tax as a percentage of total tax revenue was actually less than in the U.S., at 6.1% that same year.429 Yet another approach often cited to help resolve our crises is more regulationxxxii. More regulation of the financial sector, more environmental regulations, more employment regulations, more laws, more rules and more policies are seen as a way to reign in a destructive free market.430 The main problem is that regulation is usually designed and operated for the benefit of the industries involved, as the for-profit story tells us that profit margins are an indication of the health of the economy. So it is very difficult, if not impossible, to pass regulations that would have a detrimental impact on corporations bottom line.431 As with taxation, regulation is a top-down approach that requires political will to enact new laws, rules and policies.

Instead, this side of the spectrum calls for market-driven responses to the ecological and inequality crises of the 21st century. Such responses entail voluntary efforts on behalf of business owners and managers to take more than profit into account in their operations. Ideas such as corporate social responsibility, conscious capitalism, shared value capitalism and triple bottom line business put forth visions of a for-profit market that balances the focus on profit-maximization with concern for social and ecological wellbeing.434   One of the first attempts to make for-profit business better aligned with social and environmental goals is known as corporate social responsibility (CSR). It was a very promising concept when it first gained popularity in the 1990s. It is the idea that corporations should take more responsibility for caring for society and the environment, rather than just focusing on profit.  There arent any strict rules in the realm of corporate social responsibility, but there are best practices and CSR experts can be hired to put together a program for your company.

It is a business philosophy that seeks to incorporate social and environmental concerns into the mission of the business, thus the triple bottom line is often described in the catch phrase people, planet, profitxxxv.  Seeking to solidify the triple bottom line approach and make it tangible for businesses, various initiatives and frameworks have sprung forth, including B Corp certification, shared value, and conscious capitalism.

But in light of the fact that businesses are embedded in society and society is embedded in ecosystems, it is misguided to treat profit as if it is on an equal footing with people and the planet. Without people, theres no profit. Without the planet, there are no people. There is an obvious hierarchy of priorities that is not acknowledged by the triple bottom line approach. And, again, profit for what or for whom? Profit is still seen as a goal in the triple bottom line philosophy. For-profit businesses are set up to financially benefit private owners and so have an inherent incentive to prioritize their owners financial concerns over the concerns of other stakeholders (Ref: OToole & Vogel, 2011). This is the for-profit legal model. Environmental health and wellbeing are an afterthought in for-profit business, not woven into the fabric of the legal structure. These businesses take environmental and social concerns into account only if they are also able to generate high profits for their owners, because it is antithetical for them to sacrifice shareholder value for environmental or social concerns.435 Attempts at triple bottom line business unfortunately still tend to result in single bottom line thinking when it comes to difficult decisions in which profit, people and planet do not all naturally align.

Cooperatives do have a critical role to play in the evolution of a sustainable economy, yet we might be missing something very fundamental by grouping all cooperatives together by assuming they all treat profit in the same way. Its important to understand that cooperatives also fall along the for-profit to NFP spectrum. Not all co-ops are created equal. Some producer cooperatives are formed solely in order to maximize profit for their members. For instance, there are many agricultural cooperatives whose members are large for-profit farms. In these cases, the cooperatives goal is to negotiate the best prices for all of its members products, in order to maximize their profits, which can then be distributed to private owners. Clearly, such cooperatives remain very much for-profit and their only point of distinction from their corporate counterparts is that they adopted the 8 cooperative principles, meaning their operations are likely more democratic than a conglomeration of for-profit corporations where the biggest generally wields the most power.

So while it has many strands and variations, overall the worker-owned co-op might not be as radically different from business-as-usual as many people assume. The not-so-orthodox Marxist, Ellen Meiksins Wood, has pointed out that even workers who own the means of production will have to respond to the markets imperatives.

However, most of these efforts are grounded firmly in the very system from which inequality stems in the first place. When aid and loans are given in the for-profit context, they are formed in accordance with the for-profit story. They often end up being a form of evangelizing, to bring the less developed into the modern, consumerist, for-profit world. In many cases, aid can be tied, with the benefits flowing back to the donor nation.  Despite all of the negative impacts of the for-profit economic system, many of the leaders in developing countries have been convinced of the urgent need to participate in the global capitalist market.

In more violent cases, people are forced off of the land, when it is taken away from them by big businesses, as has happened recently in Ethiopia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Kenya.441 The aid given to the developing world will never be enough in light of the massive extent to which low-income countries are indebted, often as a result of colonialism and having a late start in the for-profit game, but also through lending from institutions, the interest payments on which dwarf the amount of aid received. In 2010, total external debt owed by developing nations was $4 trillion,442 while the total official development aid they received was $128 billion.443 This means that for every $1 in aid a developing country receives, more than $31 is owed on debt repayments. Clearly this debt maintains dependency. Many of these debts are odious  that is, the funds were siphoned off by corrupt leaders, and never benefited the people who remain saddled with paying off the debt. This is illustrative of a much wider trend.

No problem. In fact, from this worldview, hes an inspiration. The same can be said of all of the super-rich people who have signed up to the Giving Pledge, in which billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg pledge to give most of their wealth to philanthropy.

This can easily lead to an organization drifting away from its mission. Charities often dont care which companies sponsor them; they just want money. This can result in bizarre situations like the World Wildlife Fund being sponsored by Coca Cola, a company whose plastic bottles are destroying ecosystems all over the world. A tragically ironic corporate sponsorship is that of Wells Fargo - a colossal American bank that illegally processed home foreclosures via a technique called robo-signing during the economic crisis, illegally kicking people out of their homes - supporting Habitat for Humanity, an American charity that builds houses for people who are in need.449 Of course, these partnerships are great for improving the reputation of the for-profit sponsors, but they can also represent a dangerous form of mission drift for the nonprofits involved. Strategic but morally hazardous sponsorship is just a natural consequence of an economy that revolves around profit maximization. There are also plenty of nonprofit organizations that play an even more central role in the for-profit system by seeking to maximize the profits of their for-profit members. Examples of this include chambers of commerce, mutual funds, associations that lobby on behalf of for-profits, various professional associations, various sports associations, and global organizations like the World Economic Forum.

Stirrings of a Not-for-Profit Story The seeds for a not-for-profit economy are being sown In 1935, Dr. Scott Williamson and his wife, Dr. Innes Pearse, set out to find out what the causes of good health are. In order to investigate this issue, they opened the Pioneer Health Centre in a part of London called Peckham. Over the course of the next 15 years, the center provided the setting for one of the most interesting social experiments of all time; what is now commonly referred to as the Peckham Experiment.451   Over 1,000 local families used the health center, which had sporting facilities as well as a cafeteria that served organic food from a local farm.452 In the registration process, participants agreed to let researchers evaluate and monitor their activities and health over time. Aside from the researchers noting the activities of the participants, the center provided minimal rules and supervision.   Researchers noticed that the first 6- 18 months were quite chaotic, as participants learned to be more proactive and self-organize as a community. However, over the following 12 years, it was noted that there was a high level of cooperation and creative collaboration, there was no bullying, there was very little interest in competitive games, and there was a general increase in levels of health and wellbeing. Social ecologist Stuart Hill concludes that these successes were"

The Peckham Experiment offers a couple of very important lessons when it comes to laying the foundation for a more sustainable economy. First, that wellbeing is a dynamic process that is constantly being shaped by myriad factors within and around us. Secondly, under the right conditions, human nature can be extremely cooperative and altruistic.  Renewed interest in the Peckham Experiment indicates a growing willingness to think about humans in more complex terms. All of this research is changing the story of human nature and opening up a whole new potential for understanding human societies and the role of the economy. New Stories for a New World Stories create the world in which we live. They are shared beliefs about the way the world works, why everything is the way it is, what humanitys role is, and what our shared goals should be. They are the mental maps by which we navigate the world around us. These shared narratives, worldviews and belief systems shape our values and influence our feelings and our actions. As a result, our collective stories have a profound effect on the conditions in which we all live. Stories are also the way we pass on our shared beliefs, values and social norms, through generations, and from one society to another. In essence, our shared stories are the blueprints for how we organize our communities,"

The view of human nature as mostly greedy, individualistic, competitive and acquisitive has led us to build an economic system based on fear and scarcity. The profit motive and Homo economicus have wreaked havoc all over the globe.  Luckily, very different stories have been emerging and re-emerging all over the world as more people realize that the for-profit story doesnt accurately explain their feelings, behavior and experiences and, worse yet, that it is harming collective wellbeing. These stories form an overarching narrative that paves the way for a profoundly different economy. The realization that the for-profit economic system is built on an outdated, incomplete narrative about what it is to be a human on this planet is creating space for a new story to flourish. The Story of Interconnectedness The overarching new story is rooted in a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world; an understanding that everything is interconnected as part of a complex, dynamic planetary system. We call it the Story of Interconnectedness. Modern philosophers, scientists, researchers, religious leaders and artists have been exploring and trying to communicate a deeper understanding of the complexity of the world for millenia."

However, in recent decades, biologists, sociologists, philosophers, and economists alike have increasingly questioned this story. And much research has proved that in most natural systems, competition happens within a greater framework of cooperation. Cooperation is particularly important for a hyper-social species like humans.455  We can see this in todays global open-source movement. Open-source is a fundamentally different way of creating and designing technology, relying on the knowledge and skills of a large community instead of just a handful of specialists. The open-source community functions as a sort of gift economy, in which innovators contribute ideas, time and energy to the community freely and are rewarded by receiving feedback and help from community members.456 If someones contributions are deemed worthy, they will have a greater say in the decision-making process of designing a product or service, but work is largely done for the benefit of the community, not out of competitive, self-interest.457 Open-source is an ethos of share and share alike.

In light of new findings, the for-profit story of a rational, self-interested, profit-maximizing Homo economicus is dissolving into a much more complex picture of human nature. The work of Professor of Economics and Psychology at the University of British Columbia, Joseph Henrich, and his colleagues has dispelled the myth of a static, rigid human nature. They have been looking into the WEIRD phenomenon, where most economic research and thus the bulk of economic and business policy is based on the assumption that everyone in the world behaves like WEIRD people (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic). Henrich and his colleagues argue that experiments about economic behavior and human nature have traditionally been conducted by researchers at rich, Western universities, where the subjects of the experiments are often the students at those universities. Henrich and his team took the same experiments (mostly games that engage people in economic-like choices) to populations all over the world, from communities in Siberia to small tribes in the Amazon. They found great diversity in the way people responded. Their robust cross-cultural research proves that there is no set human nature, but rather that human nature encompasses an extremely wide range of characteristics.458  In addition to Henrichs exploration of economic behavior beyond WEIRD people, behavioral research tells us that our institutions and social environment play an extremely important role when it comes to which aspects of human nature we express in our actions.

In addition to recognizing that human nature is much more complex than we had previously understood, we are simultaneously coming to understand that our planet is extremely complex as well and we are interconnected with all things on Earth. We are deeply embedded in our planets ecosystems, so what happens to our ecosystems also happens to us. This understanding clearly indicates that we have a responsibility to ensure that human societies operate in ways that let ecosystems flourish; we have a duty to be ecological stewards.

A great example of the circular economy concept in action is the Baltic Biogas Bus project, which seeks to help cities in the Baltic region set up processing centers to convert municipal organic waste into biogas that they can then use as fuel for public transportation systems.464 This helps cities deal with their organic waste in a more sustainable way, cut down on fossil fuel use, and provide healthier, more affordable public transportation to their citizens.

Highly-acclaimed author Malcolm Gadwell provides a thorough exploration of the ubiquity of what is known as the inverted U curve in his book David and Goliath. He describes how, in most social phenomena, there is the tendency for more of a good thing to make us feel or do better, but only up to a point. After a certain point, more of that same thing actually makes us feel or do worse. So its like an upside-down U.

After that, the line goes down when we start getting too much of a good thing. This is very easy to understand in terms of food. If were starving, a bit of food can do a lot to improve our health, and more food will continue to do so until we have taken in sufficient nutrition. If weve eaten enough food, then more food actually starts to harm our health. This principle of enough applies to a whole host of things.  For Gladwell,"

He cites research which found having too little money makes parenting difficult, because parents must spend so much time and effort just trying to put food on the table that its difficult for them to find the time and energy to satisfy their childrens other needs. Having more money can make parenting easier for a person with limited financial means. But after a certain income level, parenting actually starts to become more difficult again (Gladwell claims that the ideal income level is about $75,000 per year in the U.S.). This is because in higher income brackets, people often have so many business endeavors and social appointments that they dont have the time and energy to also satisfy their childrens emotional needs. The art of living well is to find the happy medium.473  This idea is aptly expressed in the old proverb, Everything in moderation. You can have enough of a good thing. In Swedish, the idea is succinctly captured in one word  lagom  which roughly translates to just the right amount. In Chinese culture, xiaokang is an ancient Confucian term that refers to a situation in which people live comfortably with modest means. The principle of enough has also been verified by longitudinal studies which have found that happiness is not correlated with higher income levels after a certain point.

But Easterlins findings make perfect sense in light of complexity and the story of interconnectedness. Happiness is more complex than just having more stuff. Universal Needs Easterlins research is very closely related with important work that Chilean economist Manfred Max-Neef did in the area of human needs in the 1990s. He conducted a ground-breaking, cross-cultural investigation into what people really need in order to thrive and be well. He sought to find out whether or not there are universal needs that all humans on the planet have, regardless of background, economic standing or culture. This contrasts greatly with the well-known hierarchy of needs that psychologist Abraham Maslow developed in the 1940s, which insinuates that high-income people have different needs than low-income people and that there is a linear progression up through different levels of needs.475 Through his findings, Max-Neef identified nine universal human needs: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, leisure, creation, identity and freedom.   Universal Human Needs Max-Neef went on to create a very useful way of thinking about these needs and how we satisfy them. He envisioned our needs as a system, in which all needs are interdependent and interactive. For example, food and exercise are not really needs in themselves, but are better thought of"

Max-Neef categorized the ways in which we satisfy our needs into five different types: singular, synergistic, pseudo, inhibiting and violators. Singular satisfiers satisfy one need at a time. For example, eating a meal alone meets the need for subsistence. Synergistic satisfiers satisfy more than one need at a time. For example, a community cook-out might satisfy the needs for subsistence, participation and leisure. Pseudo-satisfiers give us the false sensation that they are satisfying our needs, when they really arent. For example, drinking a caffeinated 																																																													475	(Ref:	Maslow,	Hierarchy	of	Needs)	How	on	Earth		Working	draft	Hinton	&	Maclurcan	(2016)		136	beverage might satisfy your thirst temporarily, but caffeine can actually contribute to dehydration. Inhibiting satisfiers, which actually inhibit meeting other needs, by over-satisfying one need. For example, watching television can satisfy your need for leisure, but it might actually keep you from meeting your need for creativity, understanding, identity, and participation. And violators, under the pretext of satisfying a need, actually make it harder to satisfy that need and often also violate our ability to meet other needs. For example, censorship, which is meant to meet our need for protection, actually violates our ability to meet the need for understanding, participation, leisure, creation, identity, and freedom, which in turn makes us feel unprotected. The optimal situation is obviously to meet most, if not all of our needs through synergistic satisfiers, and to avoid pseudo-satisfiers, inhibitors and violators.476  Due to the tendency for market expansion in the name of maximizing profits, advertising in"

This has led many of us to use pseudo-satisfiers, inhibiting satisfiers and violators on a regular basis (like buying stuff we dont need and cant afford via retail therapy) and unsurprisingly we are left feeling unsatisfied, which leads us to buy more stuff in a desparate effort to fulfill our needs. And so the work-watch-shop treadmill goes on and on, in a vicious cycle. The story of interconnectedness tells us that not all needs can or should be met by buying goods and services. In fact, most of our needs can be better met outside of the market, by things that cant be paid for, like strong personal relationships, a sense of community, connection to nature, free time, self-reflection, and open spaces to explore. Initiatives like Transition Towns and the Slow Movement are helping people meet their needs through creating stronger communities and local networks of collaboration.  Places such as community gardens and tool libraries enable us to connect with others in our community and share resources, meeting our needs outside of the market.  The new story replaces the elusive Invisible Hand with a much more visible mechanism of social benefit. Rather than the vague idea that society will benefit as a result of everyone seeking to maximize their own immediate self-interest, society benefits from everybody trying to fulfill their needs in the healthiest, most synergistic ways possible.

Everyday people are increasingly thinking about the impact of their shopping patterns on ecosystems and people around the world.480   The data clearly shows that we want to buy products from companies that have a low ecological footprint and dont use sweatshops or slave labor. For instance:  77% of U.K. consumers refuse to buy products or services from a distrusted company , while 91% choose to buy from trusted companies.481  2/3 of UK adults believe it is unacceptable for shareholders to profit from running health services, children's homes, police services, and care homes for the elderly and disabled people.482   81% of consumers worldwide believe that businesses have a responsibility to address social and environmental issues,483 and 72% say business is failing at it.484  2/3 of global consumers prefer to purchase products and services from businesses that give back to society and 55% are willing to pay more for products and services from such companies (interestingly, this number grows to 63% or more in Latin America, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region).485   When consumers were asked to name the most important trait a"

Shifting Workforce Our needs, desires and expectations are also shifting when it comes to work. Decisions of what kind of work to do and for whom are moving in the direction of having more purpose, more self-direction, and more mastery.490 This is especially evident in the Millennial Generation who are, more than previous generations, drawn to jobs that allow them to feel that they are contributing to something bigger than themselves, something positive for the larger community.491 This makes sense because a large proportion of these young people have grown up painfully aware of the environmental,"

In addition to the desire for more purposeful work, there is a growing interest in more democratic and decentralized workplaces. In general, workers flourish when they have more self-direction and they can participate in decision-making at the job.495 As such, it seems that networks are to the twenty-first century, what hierarchy was to previous centuries.

This enables them to share resources, cut costs and do their work in an environment that can help them develop their ideas and strategies through interactions with others. As self-organized, self-managed networks become more common, the whole economy starts to take a different shape.  Transformation of Business The business world has also been co-evolving with the changes in our shared story. For example, many mainstream companies have seen an advantage in moving into the ethical, social and green business spheres in response to more conscientious consumers and, in some cases, as a result of a generation of genuinely concerned business leaders.   Todays global market includes a wide range of business responses. Some companies distribute a portion of profits to charities. Ben & Jerrys ice cream company donates 7.5% of pretax profits to its charitable foundation496 and Clif Bar, a company that makes energy-dense snacks, is proud to tell its customers about its commitment to environmental and social causes and that it gives 1% of its revenue to.497  There are also examples of companies that are legally registered as for-profit and have private owners, but they voluntarily give 100% of their profits to a sister charity or foundation.

In the 1990s, as the ecological crises and global inequality started becoming clearer to people, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and socially responsible investing emerged to deal with concerns that traditional ways of doing business were not addressing.533 These trends gained a lot of traction and many companies with CSR strategies outperformed their peers who were not participating in the CSR movement.534 Today, social enterprises in the U.K. are outperforming regular businesses in terms of growth and impact.535 During the 2009 economic crisis in the UK, social ventures increased by 50%, proving more successful than small business start-ups.536   In Canada, co-ops are creating jobs at nearly five times the rate of the overall economy and are generating 11% more income for their employees.537 Similarly, in Indias dairy industry, 																																																													528	(Ref:	Community	Supported	Agriculture,	M.

Attracting talented employees who add value to the company plays a key role. Studies have found that workplaces that provide a high level of engagement for employees have an important advantage in harnessing the talents and energy of their employees.542 This gives most co-ops an automatic advantage. John Lewis Cooperative in the U.K. is an excellent example of a competitive worker co-op. It has an inter-equity model for salaries that ensures that the CEO will never make more than 70 times as much as the lowest paid employee. Each of the 76,500 permanent staff is a partner in the business. The business enjoys annual revenues of over 8.2 billion and its mission is to keep its employees happy.543 This concern for employees is why worker co-ops are gaining popularity, and a competitive advantage, very quickly.544   The increasing advantages of ethical, social, local, green and democratic businesses might indicate that we are in a time of transition between economic paradigms. Traditional for-profit business is no longer adequate and is causing more problems than it is resolving. Different business models are emerging as part of an effort to better meet the challenges and needs of society in the 21st century.

Each step is a step away from the profit-motive and a step towards the purpose-motive; a step away from maximizing private self-interest and a step towards maximizing collective wellbeing. For-profit companies embodying more of an NFP ethic are already outcompeting traditional companies545 (Forbes magazine is even advising for-profits to operate more like NFPs546). So it is not a very big stretch of the imagination to postulate that NFP enterprise, as a business model, might very well outperform other business models in this time of metamorphosis and usher in a not-for-profit economic era.   We predict a shift in the primary business model of the economy from the for-profit firm to the NFP firm in the 21st century.

When this happens, they lose support and more relevant business models, which adapt the best aspects of the previous business models in order to more effectively meet the new needs, gain support.  Business model preference rested with the for-profit firm up until the 2000s largely because capital-raising mattered so much in the pre-Internet era. Companies that held proprietary knowledge and were organized in hierarchical, centralized ways had the upper hand. It was an era in which externalizing social and environmental costs was either unknown or just accepted as a necessary evil; and where worker rights were commonly traded for the promise of a higher salary or financial returns in the future. But we live in a very different world now. Negative social and environmental impacts of business are becoming less and less tolerated. And the digital era has lowered the costs of starting up and running a business, allowing for new ways of offering goods and services, marketing them, and raising capital. In other words, the for-profit firm no longer has the upper hand.  Up to now, most new business models, like social business, social enterprise and the community interest company, have placed little or no importance on distinguishing whether companies are for-profit or NFP. An increasing awareness of this important distinction is the next step; the next turn in the spiral. In addition to being socially responsible, environmentally-friendly, democratically-run and locally-based, another major advantage exists for a business to have in the twenty-first"

Its easy to take for granted that the global economy will always revolve around for-profit business, as thats how it has been throughout our lifetime, and because NFP business is so nascent. But its also important to remember that it has only been that way for about 200 years, which is not a long time in the larger scheme of things. The economy has never stopped evolving and now the crises of the for-profit, capitalist economy are birthing a new post-capitalist era. We are currently seeing signs that the NFP firm is starting to outperform the for-profit firm and many NFP enterprises already regularly out-compete for-profit counterparts.547 																																																													547	(Ref:		McLeod	Grant	and	Crutchfield,	2007,	pp.	32-41)	How	on	Earth		Working	draft	Hinton	&	Maclurcan	(2016)		145	 The nonprofit sector in the U.S. has generated more employment and higher wages in recent years, while the for-profit sector has been shedding jobs and decreasing wages.548 During the recession, from 2007- 2009, NFP employment grew in 45 of 46 U.S. states, while for-profit employment declined in 45.549  From 2000 to 2010, nonprofit revenue in the U.S. grew at a rate of 41%xliv, which more than doubled the growth of GDP during that same period.550 At roughly the same time, the growth of nonprofits (including NFP businesses) greatly outpaced the growth of for-profit businesses, at 25% compared to 0.5%.551 Globally, from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the nonprofit sectors contribution to GDP grew at an average rate of nearly 6% per year.552 In the 16 countries that have registered national accounts of their nonprofit sectors with the UNxlv, which are"

The NFP advantage is even clearer when one looks at data about specific segments of the economy, such as community-owned businesses that are outperforming their peers.

By law, they are mission-based and invest 100% of their profits back into their mission. Because of this, they are more likely to care about whether or not their supply chains are ethical, about their environmental impact, and about their employees wellbeing. They are more likely to take into consideration the concerns of the local communities in which they operate and to give their employees the chance to express themselves. And they are not at all likely to sacrifice any of these concerns in the name of profit-maximization, like for-profit businesses are. For-profit companies that are trying to incorporate ethical business practices can easily drift from a social mission due to the pressure to maximize profits or generate financial value for owners and investors. Its not that for-profit companies cant do work that has a deeper purpose; rather its that the profit motive often distracts them from that deeper purpose. NFPs dont have that built-in distraction. Thats why, in many parts of the world, people tend to trust NFPs over for-profit organizational forms and the public generally has a high level"

In CBHS, the central goal is to service our members and improve members satisfaction and offer greater benefits and thus value in the context of health insurance.569   Similarly, Nationwide Insurance Company used its lack of private owners to appeal to customers in a 2013 commercial that featured the line, ""Just another way we put members first, because we don't have shareholders.""

They work with more local farmers and producers, carry three times as many locally-sourced products, donate more than three times as much income to charities, sell twenty-four times as many organic groceries, spend six percent more of their revenue on local wages and benefits, have significantly higher rates of recycling, and are more energy-efficient than their for-profit peers.574  The German electronics company, Nager IT, provides another excellent example.

One of the reasons there are so many climate change deniers is because so many green ventures and investors really have profited in a big way from carbon trading and carbon mitigation schemes while greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Some of them had a positive impact, some did not. In any case, whenever private profit is involved, its not long before suspicion of profiteering sets in. And for good reason: the profit motive is at the helm. Even for-profits with the best of intentions will face this scenario. Financially independent NFPs are much more able to avoid that suspicion, due to their explicit social mission, the fact that no one can privately profit from them, their high levels of accountability and transparency, and the fact that theyre earning their own revenue  theyre not just an extension of for-profit sponsors.

A study of nursing homes in Minnesota revealed that NFP nursing homes do as well or better on quality measures than for-profit homes. According to resident surveys, not-for-profits had higher levels of food enjoyment, sense of safety, sense of adaptation to the living environment, general satisfaction and satisfaction with relationships than their for-profit counterparts. They also had lower levels of regulatory deficiency citations, and administration of antipsychotic drugs that were not prescribed.583 There is a constant impetus with for-profits to try to maximize the quantity of patients and money coming in, even if that means sacrificing the quality of care. And, while for-profit businesses spend billions dollars on advertising to show how much they care about their customers, connecting with customers is often just part of fulfilling an NFPs mission.   In addition to NFPs holding higher ethical standards for themselves, the public expects more ethical behavior from the NFP business community. In fact, we usually only trust NFPs and governmental agencies (which are also NFP) when it comes to the commons and public goods, because we dont trust the profit-motive to ensure basic public welfare.

It makes sense that citizens would be happier knowing that tax payer money wont go to lining the pockets of for-profit owners and investors.  For-profit companies in social sectors are increasingly coming under fire, such as for-profit universities in the U.S that are benefitting from federal student funding. On average, for-profit colleges in the U.S. receive 72% of their funding from federal programs, which means that public money is likely enriching the private owners of these universities.588 An example of the trust issues involved with for-profits in education and public funds is the recent revelation involving the U.S. military. After the Department of Defense found that the for-profit University of Phoenix was using misleading advertising tactics, including the misuse of military symbols, it declared that it would no longer allow service members to use public defense funding to attend classes at the for-profit institution.

Many Americans are also angry about the Affordable Healthcare Act (also known as Obamacare) benefitting for-profit health insurance companies. Its easy to connect the dots: the private owners and investors of these for-profit businesses are profiting from government funds. Furthermore, its been shown that NFP health insurance companies offer lower prices than for-profit counterparts in the U.S.,591 which in part is because they dont have to compensate for privately distributed profits. Obamacare might have more supporters if the program only allowed NFP insurance and healthcare providers to receive public funds. Another clear illustration of the higher ethical expectations to which society holds NFPs is the public outcry about nonprofit CEOs making large salaries.

However, the critical piece of the story that was missing from most news coverage was that the NFL is not an NFP enterprise. The NFL is a professional association, supported and financed by the 32 football teams that make up the league, 31 of whom are for-profit companiesl. Its the same with lobbying associations, which are usually nonprofits. Most lobbying associations are created solely to support the interests of for-profit companies. They are not enterprises that seek to be financially self-sufficient in order to achieve a social mission. Such lobbying and professional associations are more accurately seen as instruments of the for-profit world; appendages of the for-profit companies and industries they serve. They are the embodiment of the Nonprofit Enabler phenomenon. It would be impossible for such an obscene salary to be justified in an NFP enterprise.

Many NFP managers see this increased scrutiny as a boon rather than a constraint. As Matt Flannery, co-founder of Kiva, an NFP online lending platform says, People hold nonprofits to a high standard. They scrutinize how you spend every dollar. Im glad because it makes us stronger.593 There is even more confidence in democratically-managed NFPs, like credit unions, which are seen as more transparent than banks because they hold annual meetings that are open to all members.

In the past, big for-profit companies were often seen as able to outperform smaller ones in part because they could hire the best talent, but with changes in what people are seeking from their work, NFPs are"

Aside from the exception of for-profit cooperatives, the for-profit firm typically necessitates hierarchy. The profit beneficiaries (shareholders, investors, and owners) are on top; below them is the the CEO or president, whos charged with maximizing profits and shareholder value; below that are the managers and employees that must carry out the CEOs strategy. This is inherent in almost all for-profit business structures, not just publicly traded companies, because they exist for private profit. A profit-driven business where just a few people benefit from the profit means it logically follows that those few people have the most power and influence when it comes to decision-making. Even for-profit companies that try to take on more participatory management structures will face hierarchy when it comes to financial decisions, because there is a select group of profit-motivated individuals that have more power in such decisions.   Zappos, an online retailer owned by Amazon, made headlines when it started using the Holacracy management approach, which allows workers to essentially manage the business. But Brian Robertson, the inventor of Holacracy, says that Holacracy provides a set of core principles for shaping your business processes over time but it doesn't account for financial control or budgeting processes.600 When it comes to difficult decisions, its likely that Zappos owners at Amazon will have the final say.

That is part of the reason women continue to disproportionately favor work in the NFP sector over the for-profit sector.608  The purpose-based nature of NFPs as well as the increasing prevalence of participatory decision-making in NFPs means that there is a higher likelihood that NFP businesses will have more wage equality.609 This is because theres internal pressure in NFPs to keep salaries within a healthy range and a lower chance of employees allowing big salary gaps in companies that operate more democratically. Greater disclosure of executive incomes in NFPs compared to for-profit companies also contributes to greater wage equality. A study of NFP, for-profit, and government hospitals in the U.S. confirms this, finding that NFPs pay significantly higher wages to most paid positions.610 In other words, NFPs median salary is more, but because they pay less at the executive level, their overall wage costs are lower. This creates more pay equality and keeps the NFP business lean, because its not losing money on inflated management salaries and it doesnt need to pay exorbitantly high salaries because NFP managers are more purpose-driven.

More purpose at the workplace along with better working conditions, and more stable, equal wages naturally leads to lower levels of workplace stress and burnout. It also means lower levels of unwanted staff turnover.

As profits decline, companies cut costs by reducing wages, benefits and other amenities that make work more enjoyable for employees. Remember that for-profit wages declined by 1% from 2001- 2010, while NFP wages increased by 29% during that same period (Ref: Urban Institute). The average weekly wage for a worker in the U.S. nonprofit sector was $85 higher than in the for-profit sector in 2012.614 In addition to having a greater sense of purpose in their work, most NFP employees also tend to make more money than their for-profit counterparts. In an era of increasingly purpose-oriented workers, NFPs are in an ideal position to attract the best workers. Financial Advantages The advantages that NFPs inherently have as mission-focused businesses that attract more socially and environmentally conscious consumers as well as a more purpose-oriented workforce, also lead to financial benefits. Being purpose-based gives NFPs a significant headstart in terms of tax benefits, volunteer labor, not having to worry about dividends, receiving discounts, avoiding financially risky behavior and operating on a leaner basis more generally.   The most obvious financial advantage that NFPs have over for-profits is tax exemptions and benefits. In the U.S. healthcare sector, for instance, tax breaks to NFP hospitals amount to billions of dollars every year.615 Many policy-makers and economists have argued that tax-exempt NFPs should be legally restricted in the amount and type of business activities they can engage in, because their tax exemptions give them an unfair advantage over for-profit companies"

Another major financial advantage that NFP enterprises have in the market is that they are able to engage volunteers. Volunteers at NFPs can work full-time,622 whereas for-profit companies can usually only have part-time volunteers in most countries (if they are even allowed to have volunteers at all).  In the U.S., for instance, for-profit companies cant use interns as substitutes for paid positions, so interns are more often used for simple tasks like getting coffee, scanning documents and making photocopies.623 In NFP entities, volunteers and interns can be given work with meaning; even formal positions can be covered by volunteers.624 This can help make NFPs more resilient when finances are low.  Even in cases where a for-profit can benefit from volunteer work, at a charitable event for example, it feels more comfortable to volunteer with an NFP than with a for-profit enterprise, because nobody is privately profiting from your volunteer work, there is a clear social mission, and there is a long history of NFP volunteerism.    Globally, 971 million people engage in volunteer work in a typical year, contributing $1.35 trillion to the global economy.625 This means that the companies and organizations that engage those 971 million volunteers (the vast majority of which are nonprofits) had lower costs and more outputs than they would have had without all of"

The previous owners said that if they had not made such a move, the business would have likely failed and the fate of the collection of over 120,000 videos would have been in limbo.627 Because most NFP board members cant be paid, they are effectively volunteers, and NFPs (especially in their startup phase) are often able to draw on valuable expertise and wisdom from their volunteer board members in a very hands-on way. Its a win-win situation, because NFP volunteers derive a sense of meaning and joy from the contribution theyre making to the social missions of their chosen NFPs - otherwise, they wouldnt be volunteering their time and energy. On top of this, because our world is more tightly connected than ever in both physical and virtual terms, volunteers are more readily able to contribute their time and energy to NFPs across geographical boundaries.

This is not to say that NFP enterprises are or should be dependent on volunteers. Rather, we are highlighting this as one of many advantages NFPs enjoy over for-profits. And, like tax exemptions, volunteer work is something NFPs deserve to benefit from, as they exist purely to meet the needs of the community and that is why people want to volunteer for them.   People feel good about contributing to NFPs in these ways and an added incentive is that financial contributions are often tax deductible, meaning that people dont have to pay tax on income, goods, or services theyve donated to a NFP.629 This is a great advantage for NFPs, as their for-profit counterparts are usually on the other end of this, feeling social pressure to donate to charities. Not-for-profit businesses can also often get discounts for products and services precisely because they are NFP, largely because companies want to support the important social work that NFPs do.

This means that NFP enterprises can often get the goods and services they need in order to run their businesses at lower prices than their for-profit competitors. And, again, this is for a good reason: their work explicitly helps the wider community. In addition to benefitting from tax exemptions, nonprofit discounts, volunteers and managers who accept lower salaries, the NFP ethic is aligned with the rapidly emerging open-source movement (networks of people who freely share their ideas and work, such as software programs). This allows them to tap into many free products and services via sharing networks.  For instance, CiviCRM is an open-source contact management system specially designed for nonprofits.632 It was developed because its creators believe that nonprofits shouldnt have to use for-profit, proprietary software that doesnt give them the independence or flexibility to modify it to suit their unique needs.

Although many for-profit companies have also financially benefitted from using open-source software, the open-source community is recognising that the value created by their communities should be accessible on commercial terms for for-profit entities who are profiting from those contributing to the commons.634 Such an approach could create financial flows to enable and sustain contributors to the commons who wish to move entirely out of the for-profit economy. As a result of holding community benefit at the heart of business, the NFP structure is also more conducive to collaborating and sharing with other NFPs. This includes NFPs offering each other special discounts, but it also means that theyre more likely to combine efforts and share resources, such as physical materials, knowledge, money, and human resources, in order to achieve a common mission. Akhuwat in Pakistan uses places of worship to distribute microloans, cutting down on costs because theres less need for office space.635 The places of worship are happy to lend their space because they feel Akhuwat is aligned with their own mission of helping people in need.

Not-for-profit companies will never pay dividends or retained earnings to private individuals. The NFP non-distribution principle means that they dont lose money to anything that is not directly adding value to the company.   Shareholder financing has been important for businesses in order to raise investment capital, but dividends only serve as a drag on budgets in a future where shareholder financing is no longer necessary. After the initial injection of capital to start a company is paid back, dividends extract value from the company, as well as putting pressure on managers to focus solely on profit. Shareholders are also a source of more bureaucracy for companies to deal with, as they must allocate resources to keep track of dividends and shares.  It is estimated that cooperatives are about 20% more cost efficient than regular companies, because they dont have third party shareholder obligations.638 As some co-ops are for-profit, paying out dividends to members, this statistic is a conservative estimate.

Even though we see it as a financial advantage that NFPs cant take speculative investment, this has been one of the most prominent arguments against using nonprofit legal forms for business. The argument is that NFPs cant attract sufficient investment, because profit-hungry investors have little to gain from them. However in the market of the 21st century, the non-distributional aspect of NFPs means that theyre less likely to take on risky debt obligations and that they are more able to grow slowly and mindfully. They have to build themselves more on proven, real value, which means that in challenging economic times, they will be less likely to fail. Plus, a community thats benefitting from their work will tend to support such a company, whereas a venture capitalist is likely to cut their losses and run when things go downhill.  Prioritizing social outcomes over profit margins, NFP businesses are less likely to leverage.

In an effort to capture more short-term profits, many for-profit boards have increasingly made decisions to cut funding for basic research and bringing innovation to scale because they are not seen as core compentencies and are not central to profit-maximization.648  Compared to for-profit companies, NFP employees and managers have greater flexibility and are less fearful when it comes to innovation because they dont have a vested interest in the financial outcome, at least not beyond their ongoing employment. This means theyre generally more willing to take risks, experiment and innovate, in terms of organizational structure, technology, and strategy (in fact, many of them have had to, because they are not awash with cash). Theyre not as afraid of failure as for-profit companies, where owners, shareholders and investors are putting pressure on managers to make sure things work out for their benefit.  The for-profit approach is to only invest when the prospect of financial return exists. This means a significant lack of needed innovation where there is no foreseeable financial gain in the for-profit economy (its why certain"

Bosch seeks to honor the spirit of its founder by demonstrating social and environmental responsibility.650 About 40% of Boschs sales are products that specifically aim to minimize environmental impact and resource consumption.651 Half of its research and development (R&D) budget is invested into these products, with Bosch investing nearly double the industry average into its R&D, more generally.

There are no owners or investors asking how they will gain from such investments, and that gives The Mayo Clinic and other NFPs a degree of freedom that most for-profits in the health industry can only dream of. And that degree of freedom often translates into greater innovation; some thats profitable and some thats not, but all of it addresses major issues.  Not-for-profit businesses can also better maximize what has been called the cognitive surplus; the innate human urge to create and produce. Generally, in a for-profit company, your boss is only interested in your ideas if it can be shown that they either generate revenue or reduce expenditures. But in an NFP, you can suggest any form of internal or external innovation and expect a much more appreciative reception, often irrespective of costing. The fact that theres not a profit-maximization mandate creates a lot more space for out-of-the-box thinking and expression of ideas. This includes more space for employees to question if the goods and services that the business is producing are truly beneficial to society, whereas there is much more of a if you dont like it, then leave attitude in the for-profit sphere.

Contrary to the popular notion that performance and innovation stem from good management, studies in 2011 found that high-performance organizations were distinguished from low-performance organizations by high scores in fairness in the work place, job satisfaction and wellbeing.660 Based on all of the advantages described above, its arguable that NFP businesses are better able to meet all of the criteria for high performance. More Accessible As NFPs can more readily benefit from lower costs in terms of goods, services and wages, and because they have no one expecting a cut of the profits, they can pass these savings on to their customers.  This is another part of the reason NFPs get tax deductions  in order to make their social services as accessible as possible.

Another important strategy that NFPs use to ensure accessibility is sliding-scale fees through cross-subsidization. Sliding-scale refers to a pricing strategy wherein the customers who can afford to pay more, do pay more, enabling the company to offer lower prices to people with lower incomes, who cant pay quite enough to cover the basic cost of a product or service. If an apartment costs $400 per month to maintain at a housing co-operative, a person who has more money might pay $600 per month which enables another person to rent a similar apartment for $200 per month.

It begs the question: what if not-for-profit businesses were at the heart of the economy? Introducing the NFP World The NFP World involves an innovative market economy, centered upon not-for-profit forms of business and the not-for-profit ethic. In the NFP World, wealth and power is decentralized, yet the system operates with interconnected efficiency. Individual choice and freedom are privileged, yet the greater good prevails. Social services and safety nets have expanded, but government and taxation have contracted. Entrepreneurialism and competition help drive gains in innovation (along with innate human creativity and problem-solving), but businesses are less ruthless and aggressive.

The grey economy of under the table payments forms an insignificant portion of the community economy, given how freely wealth circulates in the NFP World.  The public sector maintains important roles in the NFP World. The state continues to run services such as government, the judicial system, the police and fire brigades. Healthcare and education are also generally publicly funded (although NFPs may run these services). Government has also developed its entrepreneurial capacities, participating more fully in the NFP market. However, government is smaller and more decentralized, with many functions having been transferred to NFP businesses, municipalities, or de-marketized, reducing the states influence over daily lives. Traditional nonprofit activities continue, but their contribution is relatively small. These include donor- or grant-dependent activities that are without a business model or subsidization via other income-generating activities in areas deemed of public importance that people are willing to fund fully, such as research centers.

Relationships exist between the various contributors to the NFP economy. Governments enter joint ventures with NFP businesses, bringing new meaning to the term public-private partnerships. Small-scale producers are members of NFP producer cooperatives. Local communities assist in managing state-owned natural resources, and community members support NFP or nonprofit projects through volunteering.  But the NFP World is much more than a shift to not-for-profit forms of business. While the separate parts that constitute the NFP economy are familiar, together they form a fundamentally different operating system, focused on advancing human and ecological wellbeing. This guiding ethic is reinforced by new narratives, values, and ways of organizing economic activity. It involves a whole new baseline for business and a new standard for the economy. The NFP ethic enables business practices to align with values like generosity, justice, compassion, caring for nature, and human rights.  We believe an NFP World is possible by 2050. Our overarching assumption is that an effective, post-capitalist economy must ensure: 1. systemic efficiency (i.e., minimal or no waste); 2. wealth circulation and decentralized access to resources; and  3. human wellbeing within ecological limits. The NFP World possesses these three characteristics in the forms of the lean society model, the wealth circulation pump, and the cycle of wellbeing.

De-monetization removes the inefficiencies associated with market transactions, also known as transaction costs (e.g., time, travel, middlemen, interest, and taxation).

This results in saved resources on many fronts. For example, the battle against environmental policies by for-profit companies in the current economy wastes a lot of energy that, put to social outcomes, could be really powerful. Imagine if all of the money and time that companies currently spend on lobbying against taxes and regulations (in order to cut their costs and generate more profit) was instead spent on taking care of forests, cleaning up beaches, or even helping people find work that gives them a sense of purpose. The NFP economys saved energy comes from merging entrepreneurialism and social outcomes through business structures that circulate wealth throughout the real economy, thereby avoiding the social disruption that comes from wealth extraction via profit-seeking. The NFP World model is also simpler in this way, because there are fewer conflicts of interest. The NFP World is a lean economic model that seeks to find the most efficient ways to meet needs, so superfluous aspects of the economy that either dont aid this mission or actually hinder it (like speculation through financial markets) do not survive long, as theyre potentially harmful to the whole system and theyre simply not needed. The wealth circulation pump Modern economic theory is built on scarcity. In capitalism, scarcity-based thinking justifies the wealth extraction siphon and the narrative of never enough. But its rare for us to consider what happens"

In doing so, we discover that, when scarcity is removed, health is restored to the economys critical organs: finance, businesses, the market, the state and international relations. How is this possible? In the NFP World, the circulation of wealth, derived from purpose-driven economic activity, is self-perpetuating. In other words, distribution is built into this market system. The restricted ability for private gain, via the predominant NFP form of business, means that everyday economic activities fuel the wealth circulation pump. 																																																													679	The	unrelated	business,	subsidiary	model	means	there	is	some	extra	energy	is	needed	to	ensure	the	fulfilment	of	social	needs		money	needs	to	be	transferred	over	from	a	separately	governed	company,	but	its	still	a	lot	more	efficient	than	the	FP-to-NP	via	the	Government	flow	of	capital	and	the	Nonprofit	Enabler	effect.

Internal operating expenses, include payments to external providers who are also NFP, thereby fueling the wealth circulation pump, as well as wages. Wages also fuel the wealth circulation pump, because: 1) the extractive impact of owners is absent; 2) wages more accurately reflect the contribution of workers; and 3) companies operate in more participatory ways that maintain limits on wage disparities.  Wages then either go towards spending, saving, or philanthropy. Spending fuels the wealth circulation pump, even through activities such as purchasing insurance, luxury goods and services, or participating in public lotteries.680 As for savings, people invest their money in a NFP bank, the bond market, or assets.

Commercial loans strengthen the NFP infrastructure for the wealth circulation pump and personal loans enable the fulfillment of individual and family needs.

When people spend into philanthropy, then the money is directed towards social purposes through nonprofit and NFP organizations in ways that once again prime the wealth circulation pump. In addition to wages, other operating costs that an NFP enterprise has to cover might include: taxes, which of course go to support things that society deems important such as infrastructure or pension funds, and other forms of social security for employees. They might also need to invest in more machines, furniture or other physical capital, which they would buy from other NFPs. All of these operating costs keep the wealth circulation pump operating. One operating expense that might not contribute to the wealth circulation pump is the rent that some NFPs have to pay for their space. A private person could own and rent the space out. In the current economy, private real estate ownership is a major source of wealth for some, so this is an important concern. However, in the NFP World, most commercial space is owned by"

The second thing that might happen with the money you spend at an NFP business is that it contributes to the businesss profits. Financial surplus can be used by an NFP business to: a. further its mission, including the creation of publicly accessible capital and infrastructure, as well as supporting socially-beneficial682 goods and services;  b. keep as savings, with a NFP financial institution; c. invest, directly or indirectly in other NFPs; or  d. give as philanthropy to other nonprofit or NFP entities. As you can see, whenever an NFP business spends money on operational costs or uses its profits for any of the above activities, it helps generate real value in the economy. Through the majority of possible interactions, wealth circulates, rather than accumulating in an elite economy. Value creation stems from the expansion of individual and community assets necessary for living, greater wellbeing, developments in tangible and intangible social infrastructure, and enhancement and expansion of the commons. Without private business ownership, wealth can circulate in service of greater wellbeing for everyone. The power and efficiency of this wealth circulation mechanism can be seen in parts of the existing, for-profit system that are increasingly run by NFPs.

It contributed to more equality rather than more inequality. Thus, a distributional mechanism is built into the very DNA of the not-for-profit economy, leaving very little need for redistribution. It is not an afterthought or a strategy to compensate and mitigate the undesirable side effects of a for-profit market. The wealth circulation pump doesnt require trickle-down economics, government stimulus, or the belief in an Invisible Hand that mysteriously turns self-interested accumulation into social good. Any form of consumption drives wealth around the system. But this is different to what Keynes advocated because the pump is based on existing needs, not manufactured demand. This means theres less need for neo-Keynesian intervention (prices/incomes) and monetarist policy (interest rate adjustments). The wealth circulation pump in the NFP World changes everything by introducing abundance and real liquidity into the system. It is worth noting that not all wealth circulates freely in an NFP World; some aspects of the economy continue to have a siphoning effect. Some forms of capital gains still exist.

To begin, the combined size of the forces that centralize wealth has been drastically diminished in the transition to the more equal NFP World. As the NFP story took hold and rampant accumulation of wealth went from being exhalted as a sign of success to being socially unacceptable684. In fact, the NFP World would not exist without a strong foundation of social norms, values, and shared goals, grounded in the NFP story of social-ecological wellbeing outlined"

This means that the rich now have less capital for investment. There are also significantly fewer avenues for capital accumulation, now that securing business equity is not an investment option. And the financial returns on lending capital as debt are contained via social pressures, the abundance of investment capital, and, in some cases, legal restrictions (for instance, on the amount of interest one can charge on a loan). Similarly, wealth from asset appreciation is less of an issue, thanks to reduced inflationary possibilities. And, given there is no elite economy in which accumulated wealth can circulate, those with greater wealth in the NFP World more readily spend it back into the real economy (and of course there is much less inequality in the NFP World due to the wealth circulation pump, so the wealthier households only have a small factor more wealth than poorer households). Moreover, with an ethic of enough having replaced the fear-based, scarcity mentality, and in a condition of greater socio-economic equality, individuals dont feel compelled to accumulate for accumulations sake. Rather, their focus is on converting financial prosperity into greater wellbeing, their own, the wellbeing of others, and the wellbeing of the planet. Public beneficence, not private accumulation, is now the celebrated form of individual and business success. And if that isnt enough to discourage hoarding, capital accumulation via capital gains is financially disincentivized via taxation. In practice then, the NFP World maintains healthy levels of equality because its circulating forces are greater than its accumulating forces (see"

Thus, the return to a highly unequal world is unlikely, because theres widespread awareness of the siphoning effects that create an elite economy and the damage that kind of economy does to people and planet; and thus there is much attention placed on minimizing the siphon and counter-balancing it by enhancing the circulation of the wealth circulation pump.  The wealth circulation pump acts universally (both within and between countries), equalizing the lack of freedoms and the fulfillment of the conditions for a healthy, happy life. This acceleration of wellbeing is most noticeable on the level of local economies. Countless communities had been negatively affected by the globalized wealth siphon of the for-profit era. These local economies see the greatest improvement in the NFP World because wealth now stays local. National and regional taxation ensures certain communities dont become exorbitantly wealthy. With millions of NFP enterprises and the NFP ethic running the economy, we expect to see a lot less war-profiteering, inhumane working conditions, and exploitation of poorer people.

It is of course acknowledged that material and financial wealth can be means to achieving high levels of social-ecological wellbeing, but they are seen as a means rather than an end. This means that there is a level of not enough material wealth, which is not good, but there is also a level of material wealth that can be detrimental to social-ecological wellbeing. Actors in the NFP World, whether individuals, households, businesses, cities or nations, seek the level of material and financial wealth that provides for optimal human and ecological health. As such, the work-watch-shop spiral of despair has been replaced by the work-rest-zest cycle of wellbeing. The cycle of wellbeing stems not only from what the NFP World actively creates, but also from what it simply doesnt do. The NFP World doesnt systematically create inequality. It doesnt encourage ecological destruction, war, exploitation, workaholism, and consumerism in the name of profit (as described in chapter 3). It doesnt tear communities and families apart for the sake of productivity and competitiveness. In the NFP World, businesses rarely market their goods and services in ways geared towards making people feel inadequate. We are no longer exposed to thousands of ads per day.

Greater localization and sharing means that needs are increasingly met outside the market, reducing the need for money and formal employment. Businesses no longer manufacture needs to keep their profit margins (and the economy) growing.  Rather, the needs that cant be met outside the market, are efficiently addressed through the socially-oriented market. Thanks to the lean society model, the efficiency with which NFP enterprises respond to social and environmental challenges reduces the negative externalities that are often created by inefficient processes. Increased attention on environmental wellbeing leads directly to greater human wellbeing, improving conditions such as air, water and soil quality, ensuring more livable environments and nutritious foods.  Many NFPs produce goods and services that emphasize beneficial, long-term outcomes, which in turn, reduce the amount of work required by society. In healthcare, for example, there is a greater focus on preventative medicine, rather than the allopathic approach that dominates the for-profit healthcare model. This sensitivity to long-term considerations sees ecological design become the norm, as witnessed by extended product lifecycles through built-in resilience in manufacturing, and a focus on energy and waste reduction.

No need to create useless jobs in the NFP World to prop up employment in the market, because of the wealth circulation pump and needs being met outside the market, through community and family connections. In the NFP World, capacity of production is purposefully underutilized. While this will undoubtedly shock all kinds of economists, its less shocking when you realize why: its to ensure greater leisure and healthy ecosystems. Unemployment from labor surplus is a pronounced problem in systems based on scarcity. In the NFP World, the workweek is much shorter, so paid work is more easily spread out among the population and everyone spends less of their life doing paid work. Full employment is less critical (a term that has often been used as a smokescreen for socially and ecologically harmful policies).

Businesses reflect this understanding in their practices. Greater transparency about the ecological impacts associated with products and services further spurs conscious consumption.

Manufactured needs, wasteful production, and mindless consumption are things of the past. Without profit as a goal, doing damage to humans and other species is unjustifiable, so economic externalities, like air pollution, are more naturally internalized. Even if a company does not automatically take its full ecological impact into consideration, when it learns of its mistakes from its stakeholders, community and public officials, it is much more willing to"

The market also no longer seeks to commoditize everything, because there is a widespread realization that many needs are best met in non-material ways, including stronger personal relationships that allow for greater rates of re-use and sharing. The willingness of the market to trade economic growth for the fulfillment of needs also facilitates more closed-loop systems design, reducing the ecological impacts of trade by slowing resource throughput, thereby enabling a steady-state, non-growing economy. When the paradox of enough combines with the lean society model, the wealth circulation pump and the cycle of wellbeing, we see the makings of a new economy. But when it gets to the details of how the NFP economy actually works, what we discovered in this regard was nothing short of breathtaking. When we first began developing the NFP World model, we thought that the emergence of NFP business would make many of our existing structures obsolete. Nothing could be further from the truth. Almost everything that is unhealthy with our present, for-profit economy, becomes healthy under NFP conditions, from fractional reserve banking, to compounding interest, debt, advertising, lobbying"

We begin our deeper exploration with what sits at the heart of any economy: finance. The abundance of NFP finance When all banks are not-for-profit698, something profound happens with money creation, debt and interest. Recall that, through for-profit banking, money is constantly extracted from the real economy to the elite economy. Thirty-five to forty percent of the money we pay for goods and services goes to bankers, financiers, and bondholders via interest699. The scarcity this creates in the real economy demands an ongoing expansion of debt by the average citizen (and government), who cant afford to fully service their loans without taking on further debt700.  																																																													698	The	range	of	banks	considered	NFP	include:	credit	unions,	savings	and	loans	associations,	building	and	loans	associations,	community	banks,	central	banks	and	public	banks.

Because average levels of household, community and government wealth are much greater in the NFP World, debts are more easily and quickly reconciled, similar to what happens in Its a Wonderful Life701. And in a world focused on addressing social-ecological needs, with more needs met outside the market, the reduced costs of living make taking on debt less necessary in the first place and, with higher rates of socio-economic equality, debt is also easier to pay off.

Not only does it promote financial liquidity and the ability for households, communities, businesses and governments to finance the servicing of needs, it also represents social assurance, trust, interdependence and community confidence in the economy and the ability of debtors to repay their loans. Fair interest on loans remains an important component of a healthy, NFP banking system. Compounding interest discourages reckless borrowing and encourages the borrower to repay loans efficiently. Interest also rewards the lender for taking a risk (like a fee for the service of providing the loan), and compensates for any inflation within the economy, although, as well soon see, this holds less relevance in the NFP World. Yet, the motivation to gain personally from interest payments disappears when the bank isnt shareholder-owned. Rates are calculated to account for administrative costs (including wages of bank employees), levels of risk, and the development of capital reserves. Nothing more.

But, if needed, rates can be regulated for upper maximums, as in many U.S. states, where it is illegal to charge more than 10 percent annual interest on consumer loans.702   Furthermore, because NFP banks only exist to provide high-quality financial services to their customers, they are responsible lenders. With stronger ties to the community and borrowers, theyre able to assess risk and work out terms and policies that ensure lower default rates. Not-for-profit banks dont intentionally give bad loans and this can be seen in our present economy in which credit unions offer fairer interest rates and were not nearly as tied to bad mortgages as for-profit banks in the 2008 crash703. And their not-for-profit ethic ensures NFP banks dont sneak in new fees or seek to extract as much wealth from customers as possible. No one would benefit from unnecessary fees but the customers, when they get a rebate at the end of the year, so it makes no sense to charge them in the first place.  Combined, these features restore banking to its naturally valuable function: providing households, businesses and governments with a secure place to store savings, and with the loans to start projects and businesses or address personal needs. An entirely NFP banking sector keeps the circulation of financial resources moving throughout the economy, for the benefit of all.

That said, alternative approaches to finance can happily co-exist within a NFP system. The JAK Members Bank in Sweden, for example, having successfully conducted interest-free, full-reserve banking since 1965704 would operate just as fine (and might gain even more members) in an NFP World. And interest-free, Islamic banking (Sharia compliant) can continue just as it is presently practiced in much of the Islamic world, as long as there is no private equity involved.

Inspired by leadership in Germany, Brazil, Russia, India and China705, public banking is one such innovation that is crucial to the NFP World. Public banks are financial institutions run by governments at the national, regional, county or municipal levels. While variations exist706, most public banks have similar functions:  they offer a repository for government revenue;  they provide the government, or specific industries with low cost capital to develop infrastructure;  they have a mandate to lend counter-cyclically, i.e., when there is a block in liquidity; and  their profits offer a substitute for tax revenue.

However, their newfound independence708 makes them a valuable check and balance for the wellbeing of the NFP economy, and they remain the lender of last resort for large, private-sector NFP banks and public banks. But, rather than focusing on how to boost consumption and GDP growth, their mandate for ensuring liquidity is driven by the desire to improve social wellbeing. In this sense, they still assist with inflation rate targets by helping to manage the money supply and setting central interest rates709, but they do so with a different end goal. Deflation is certainly less of a concern in the NFP World.

Here, the overall reduction in the money supply (debt) changes everything. Due to economic abundance, a banks creation of money, as debt, only increases the money supply temporarily. This is because this debt can be efficiently serviced, often without the need to create more debt in the process711. And when the economy doesnt have to incessantly grow, theres less need to expand the money supply via quantitative easing and other such measures712, reducing the possibility of inflationary pressure. A naturally declining population, less speculation, more socio-economic equality, and the drastically smaller size of the global economy (in terms of both money and production), also means less vulnerability to irregularities or market failures, further offsetting inflationary pressures. Dramatic boom-and-bust cycles end because asset values dont have a natural tendency towards over-valuation. Additionally, the steady circulation of wealth, along with considerable re-localization of manufacturing and trade, greatly reduces the volatility of prices and market demand. With a reduction in the overall number of hours employees work to earn an adequate paycheck, and NFP companies caring more about employee wellbeing as an internal aspect of their social missions, employment and wages are more stable, contributing to reduced variability in costs. This means inflation is contained, and deflationary and inflationary spirals are extremely rare and less severe in the NFP World.

Loans and bonds with fixed rates of return continue to drive new NFP business development, expansion and working capital, given individuals cant hold equity in an NFP714.

Volunteers can play a big role in meeting the needs of the disproportionately large elderly population715.  In terms of investment, lending (as compared to equity-based investment), generally offers long-term stability for borrowers and the economy, given it is a source of fixed income and is less prone to speculation. While a spectrum of risk remains716 (allowing those less concerned about the certainty of their long-term savings to support more risky ventures that may have a higher rate of return), destructive speculation is largely absent; and the spectrum of possible returns is narrower. This is especially due to the abundance of investment capital and because, overall, most ventures are averse to reckless risk-taking, now that profit-maximization is no longer the purpose of business development.

Indeed, businesses and governments regularly connect with and provide updates to their investors, in part because these people are often wonderful patrons and ambassadors for the projects in which they are invested. However, for NFP projects in which an investors stake is purely financial, the investors ability to influence decision-making is legally restricted717. This is in stark contrast to our present, for-profit world, in which the owners of capital often have voting rights and a greater ability to influence a companys direction than the workers or the companys board (with shareholder decisions and expectations typically favoring profit-maximization at any cost).

And while younger people still need to borrow more than the older generations who, in turn, provide most of the capital for lending, it is much easier (and maybe even common) for average people to transition to being a lender, rather than a borrower, as they grow older in the NFP World.  The wealth circulation pump provides citizens with a greater capacity to save, particularly due to higher take home pay and reduced costs of living. With greater average wealth, governments have greater reserves, and more people can afford small to medium-size investment risks on projects with social outcomes.
