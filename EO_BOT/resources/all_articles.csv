Effects of the soil surface roughness and soil moisture content on the soil spectral signature,https://medium.com/geo-university-learning-content/effects-of-the-soil-surface-roughness-and-soil-moisture-content-on-the-soil-spectral-signature-cdfacafa4ea1?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,https://medium.com/@dimsyk,Medium,1,"The purpose of the current study is to simulate conditions and phenomena such as specular reflections and soil roughness that are encountered when airborne or satellite hyperspectral images are acquired. Relationships between soil moisture and soil surface roughness as well as their effect on the soil spectral signature are investigated. Seven natural (not sieved, not dried, undisturbed) samples of soils were used for the experiments. They have heterogeneous characteristics and their volumetric moisture content (VMC), as well as their surface roughness were artificially changed. The spectral measurements took place under laboratory conditions with a full spectrum (350nm-2500nm) ASD spectroradiometer. Spectral similarity measurements and spectral matching were applied on the soil spectral signatures in order to investigate sensibility of soil spectral signatures in various roughness and VMC values. To study the effect of soil moisture and surface roughness at the soil spectral signature, a new metric, the relative difference (RD) metric is defined and used. The variation of soil signature intensity in terms of surface roughness at different soil moisture levels is also investigated. Moreover, the Normalized Difference Soil Moisture Index (NSMI) was used for estimating the VMC. It was proved robust, yielding accurate results for soils that do not present staggering water on their surface."

We’ve seen such events in science already. For example biology, being around for centuries, giving us an understanding of evolution, medicine and many other useful things, was for a long time limited to qualitative research, confined to observing the world, finding extremely intriguing things, but mostly searching for clear “Yes or No” answers. But at some point this was no longer enough as quantitative analysis became essential to get an answer. This is where physicists got interested in it, launching biophysics, and things started to change fast."

For decades remote sensing scientists were analyzing satellite imagery. I imagine it was quite a challenge to understand multi-spectral aspects of EO, atmospheric distortions in the data and similar issues. However, results were mostly maps, pictures and stories, a chart here and there. Very few things were deterministic. For example, how did we come with the “fact” that vegetation has NDVI from 0.3–0.8, while soil has 0.1–0.2? There were various indices created, NDWI, EVI, NBR and others, but they are all plagued with similar issues as NDVI — interpretation of index values, impact of atmospheric conditions to these, etc.. Strangely enough it is sometimes difficult to even get a clear formula for a specific index as even these are often described, in scientific papers, in words alone. This is why we created the “Custom Scripts repository” — to have one place where this knowledge is described in a deterministic manner. Still, we cannot solve the “legend” issue as we get asked many times “what does a moisture index of 0.6 stand for”. These limitations resulted in most of the scientific results being overly fine-tuned for a specific case, making it very difficult to produce regional or global solutions."

It seems to coincide with the Sentinel-2 mission and Copernicus starting to freely distribute good-quality data globally every few days, which made it interesting to a wider group of people. These are bringing missing “tools” to the remote sensing field — statistics and related neural networks, combined with accessible powerful cloud infrastructure and loads of data."

It’s fun being part of the infancy of the “new remote sensing” — the possibility to extract quantitative information from satellite imagery, almost like querying some virtual database. However, we all have to be honest to ourselves: we are still learning and the existing results are pretty constrained. I am confident that we can do much more than count cars on the parking spots, planes and ships and oil tanks. In this phase we will (all) get best results if we cooperate as much as possible. This is why we have designed our approach to EO machine learning, eo-learn, as an open-source library — we hope that other users will contribute to it or at least help us test it thoroughly. It will make progress faster."

There is a reason for that as well. Creating a platform, which everyone is using, for sure sounds sexy. Unfortunately, it is also pretty limiting. If someone requires a function that is not available in a platform, they will simply go to whichever platform that has that functionality. There is also a matter of an IPR. People who have a really good idea on what to do with EO data are not too fond of putting their know-how into someone else’s platform, especially if this someone could end up becoming their competitor. This is why we believe that a service-based approach is the right thing. There is a bit more work to accomplish it (we try to minimize this by preparing various integration packages), but whoever plans to generate revenue with their solution is willing to invest this effort. And they have all the freedom to design their solution however they like, using our services for Sentinel data, some 3rd party service for weather data, eo-learn libraries, their own tools and another plethora of small pieces to make the best possible solution."

When we started with Sentinel Hub, we were focusing on client-based tools to process the data. But we realized that there are not many people who are willing to pay for such a service as most of them were able to do it themselves, albeit taking quite a bit of their time. It was difficult to build a business model on top of it. Therefore, when creating EO Browser we ditched business approach and provided it free of charge. We might have lost some potential revenues, but we gained much more. EO Browser is not just a marketing tool, it is actually raising awareness about Sentinel data throughout the world, generating demand for it. Some of this demand comes back to us in terms of Sentinel Hub services subscriptions. Due to EO Browser’s open-source policy it also represents a good integration example and there are quite a few of our users, who decided to build commercial applications on top of it."

Adding couple more requirements like high pointing stability, ability to survive the launch, remote control and monitoring capabilities made the development even more difficult. Oh, and you remember that it had to do it all in not very welcoming space environment right? Optical components are not big fans of vacuum conditions."

A2D was built to collect data in pre-launch campaigns. The data had to be analysed and validated against ground station measurements which would also allow for better sensor calibration. Test campaigns were performed in such extreme locations as Schneefernerhaus observatory situated 2650 meters above sea level and over Greenland and Iceland territories near the Arctic Circle."

Initial model, created in early 1970s was updated allowing to describe shape of backscattered light up to accuracy of 98% which translates into improved accuracy of measurement of molecules speed in the atmosphere — the main purpose of ALADIN. The improvement not only allowed to better Aeolus sensor but also improve state-of-the-art for other lidar sensors using this model."

However, one of the most important renewable resource our communities and all of life relies on is, in fact, groundwater. While these stores of water deep beneath the surface, existing in soil pore spaces and rock formation fractures, are very much “out of sight, out of mind”, groundwater physically supports our cities, quenches the thirst of our crops, and plays a vital role in Earth’s ecosystems. Unfortunately, many regions deplete this invaluable resource at rates in which it cannot be replenished — perhaps even to the point of crisis. Over-pumping of groundwater has been sinking cities, causing water contamination, and drying up wells worldwide."

NASA’s GRACE-FO twin satellites provide the first opportunity to directly measure groundwater changes from space. By observing changes in the Earth’s gravity field, scientists can estimate changes in the amount of water stored in a region through their accompanying gravitational changes. Launched in March 2002, GRACE provides 10+ year-long data record for scientific analysis. This record, combined with data on changes in snow and surface soil moisture, can be used to calculate detailed changes in groundwater volume over a given period of time."

Through the application of GRACE Level-2 data, with additional post-processing or potential ancillary data, one is able to generate gridded, location-specific products (monthly and time-averaged) with the most up-to-date corrections. With its capabilities to visualize parts of the Earth unseen, this dataset has revolutionized investigations regarding water reservoirs over land, ice, and oceans, as well as earthquakes and crustal deformations.

There are many answers, some practical, some philosophical, but perhaps one interpretation most of us can agree on is that Society is “this thing we all live in”. The “we” and “all” are important words, making clear that Society is a mixture of all types of people with all levels of education and skill. We should not lose track of the fact that Society is not to be equated with a “captive EO community”, where people who know access the data they need. In doing something “for Society”, we need to produce something useful for everyone, not just those already clued up."

In European contexts, such services would query public environmental data base such as air quality, river discharge and aquifer data base, in case of near real-time delivery. In southern countries, the lack of monitoring programs and data diffusion/transparency together with fast land use changes, recurrent disasters (floods, drought) and highly variable climatic conditions could easily be being evaluated/monitored using EO. We intend to develop a service based on user enquiry to answer to such questions: Is the forest exploited right now around me? What are our drinkable water stocks for the dry season? Am I in a rain shadow zone to develop my crops?"

This service would target southern countries where these kind of variables, when monitored by governmental services, are not publicly released or not in a near-real time. The targeted audience is first — a non-GIS expert that could be politically engaged to — micro-businessmen or simply curious citizens, NGO, consulting or insurance companies that would not be capable to get this information from elsewhere and in a near real time. The enquiries collected from users can be a feedback to learn what environmental issues are common in the place where the users are querying the app. Another perspective of this service is to build more specific analyses of EO for diverse and local environmental issues that could be tackles using the platform behind the app. It targets more specialized and expert public to develop appropriate analyses of EO for environmental issues."

This service provides a simple form to select one Region Of Interest (e.g. Hyderabad area) and the available environmental variables to be monitored (e.g. hydric stress). Each time new data is available on the platform, the environmental variables is automatically computed on the Region Of Interest and compared to reference values range. For every variable that is out of range, the backend server pushes an alert and the user is notified within the SnapPlanet application. Opening the notification displays the processing result in a comprehensive way within the application."

Indian agriculture consumes more than 80% of the water used in the country, these amounts varying widely from year to year. The groundwater contribution to irrigated water has risen by 90%, encouraged by subsidized electricity for farmers in the two last decades. This financial support changed the status of this water resource from an emergency supply, in case of surface water scarcity, to the main water source for irrigated crops. In that highly irrigated context, the water used for domestic consumption is minor compare to the agricultural use. A small relative increase of agricultural water consumption can threaten the domestic needs, which increase at high rates with urban areas expansion, This situation has led to water shortages and bring the competition for water to a spatial dimension. Runoff from monsoon is captured within a rainwater harvesting system composed by hundreds of thousands small water tanks, spread along the drainage network in upstream parts of the country (see figure below). Initially dug for agriculture irrigation, these tanks are now used as Managed Artificial Recharge (MAR) basins for increasing natural recharge. The evaporated and recharge water volume are missing downstream for aquatic ecosystems and others human uses."

This development has led to many issues in terms of employment, housing and basic services such as tap water distribution, but has also led to develop an urban civil society highly engaged in environmental issues. In Hyderabad, multiple associations are gathering citizen to promote local organic food consumption or protect ancient granite formations of the Deccan Plateau (Society to save Rocks), or protest against destruction of natural areas for urbanization."

These dams, filled with monsoon runoff of upstream catchment, can be empty after several dry years. But the increasing demand for domestic water has led to systematic more or less long shortage periods at the end of the summer period (from April to June) which force authorities to cut the water distribution. A black market of groundwater, coming from the Hyderabad surroundings to fill water tank of each buildings, partly fulfils this domestic water demand. The more long the shortage last, the higher the prices become. This situation will quickly worsen. Indeed, no realistic aquifer management plans are set up by constraining farmers to stop pumping before a lower limit. On the contrary, for electoral reasons, farmers got an extension of free electricity periods in Telangana, allowing them to use more groundwater in less time. This emergency supply for domestic water is threatened in coming years."

There have been two problems with this: 1) the definition of “society”, which has traditionally been too restrictive in EO contexts (i.e. limited to people who know), 2) there have not really been the tools to do it. One contributor to this proposal was at ESA / ESRIN in the mid 1990s when the “next next” generation of services were being discussed, and of course at the time, the mobile revolution had not quite taken place. Today, the Citizen can use EO for everyday purposes through the use of social media oriented services, from a handheld mobile."

Earth observation in general is the gathering of information about planet Earth’s physical, chemical and biological systems as well as the monitoring and assessing the status and changes in the natural and man-made environment. The fascinating thing is that most of the data is freely available. Daily and for every place on earth. It’s also fascinating that you can use your smartphone to send certain satellites an order to take a picture of a selected area on Earth — and it’s available for download just a few hours after it’s taken."

I used optical sensors to detect illegal logging in the tropics and the effects of refugee camps on the environment. And I created highly accurate terrain models and counted the trees in Switzerland based on airborne laser scanning.

First the data: Never before have so many data been available in such a high temporal and spatial resolution — as from the Sentinel Missions of the European Space Agency ESA. Never before has computational power and the handling of very large amounts of data been so easy — just think of cloud computing and web services. And image processing methods have never been as advanced as they are today — where it is almost standard to integrate artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning.

And right in our first project, DeFROST funded by ESA, we were able to bring together all these great possibilities: large amounts of data from 6 different operational satellite missions, an algorithm that made possible a unique product and combined different approaches of machine learning, and a processing chain that, once set up, runs fully automatically and improves the product with each new image. Here — take a look at our derived snow cover product. Daily updated, gap free (yeah, and that despite a very frequent dense cloud cove) and in an incredible spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m.

But, it’s not only the people who eagerly anticipate snow during the holidays — seasonal snow is a very integral part of our planet’s climate system. It helps both regulate the temperature of the Earth’s surface and maintain a healthy energy balance. Additionally, water from snowmelt is crucial for replenishing rivers and reservoirs across the world. Snow can also affect the arrival of the summer monsoon season and influence how long it will last."

And if satellite images are our data, then we refer to the data that describe these images. What time were they taken? What was the sensor’s geometry at that time? Where exactly, in the Earth, does the image refer to? These kinds of questions are answered by the metadata. In this tutorial, we will refer to three main types of parameters: projection info, solar angles and sensor angles. The meaning of these parameters is the same for any type of sensor (passive or active), however for the time being, we will refer only to applications of optical remote sensing."

This hypothetical shape, assuming the oceans are under the influence only of Earth’s gravity and rotation, is called geoid, and it is an irregular equipotential surface. This means that it cannot be described by basic geometric shapes (irregular) and that the force of gravity towards the Earth’s mass center is perpendicular to every point in that surface (equipotential). Now, since it is irregular, it cannot be described by analytic mathematical equations, therefore it cannot be used directly as a reference of position. However, we can use its property of being equipotential in order to approximate it accurately with a reference ellipsoid."

First of all, public users need a basic understanding of the EO related products and of the ICT tools for EO products analysis. They also need a good knowledge about the space mission operation schema within all the process, from planning to delivery. Public users should also handle the definition of the requirement (based both on cases definition and testing approach) and develop methodologies based on short loops."

A better user requirement analysis is needed, to generate technical specifications, as much as the calculation and validation of the EO product performance parameters. Another necessary skill is the capacity to understand the basic operational needs, as target goals variability and availability. Interface handling is also a needed skill for the experts, as the data and information processing and fusion (from EO and auxiliary data gathering up to GUI) and the validation of the implementation based on use cases. To generate little capabilities demonstrators, based on available tools or platforms, and to develop methodologies based on short loops are other responsibilities of the experts."

There was in 1998 a world satellite conference in Lisbon where similar questions were made to EO scientists present. The question was: “how could general public relate and understand the importance of space/geospatial products, particularly those obtained by sensors aboard satellite systems?”. Twenty years later, this question is still very pertinent, especially if we think in terms of EO and not GNSS. GNSS applications are easier to understand or perceive by general public, since the use of smartphones became very normal even in less developed regions of the world. On the other hand, it is much more difficult to explain public users how EO services can help their daily tasks and, particularly, how can public users manipulate and/or understand this data."

It is essential to establish short-term but regular courses, where the basic principles of EO and derived products can be administered to public users, so they can understand the EO products and at the same time express the difficulties they feel in interpreting these products. For many other professional fields this concept is quite natural: users have to keep up with these courses to exercise efficiently their profession."

For those students that were never exposed to this field, it is very difficult to understand what type of information they can obtain from a scene/data. They cannot understand how this binary data is formatted, how was really acquired, how deep a sensor penetrated in the ocean, etc. This means that they experience severe difficulties to understand how they can use this data to their research studies. Space Technologies should not be an optional subject, but it must become a compulsory discipline for those who want to follow marine studies."

From the early days of SAR when imaging was performed using photographic film technology, to modern times where enormous images can be formed on a single computer in practically no time with exquisite accuracy and resolution, there have been tremendous advances in the field. These advances have been, to some degree, motivated by the increasing availability of high-quality SAR data from the ever-expanding fleet of international airborne and space borne SAR systems in both the civilian and military sector."

The SIR-A mission took place in 19841 with an L-band HH-polarization SAR on board similar to SEASAT-SAR. The SIR-B mission later followed in the year 1984 with SAR operating at the same frequency and polarization as SIR-A, but varying incidence angles by a steered antenna."

The main reason for the heavy weight is that the satellite carries many sensors on board. ENVISAT (ceased its mission in May 2012), for example, carried 10 optical/infrared and microwave instruments including ASAR (Advanced SAR). ALOS (ceased its mission in May 2011) carried PALSAR and two optical sensors."

The platform marked a key milestone of our original commitment to provide license-free data and tools to people around the world. We designed targeted educational resources to help socialize users to the different features of the platform, showcasing what is possible with remotely sensed data. We also strengthened our collaborations with existing partners through joint projects and formed new alliances to support community-led projects. The establishment ofMLHub Earth, an open source machine learning commons for Earth observation, is one of those collaborations, formed to promote the creation of inclusive labeled images and algorithms to democratize machine learning applications for Earth observation data. We anticipated that the Earth observation landscape would continue to expand and innovate, and subsequently leveraged our expertise as a neutral entity to bring together the right voices to further reduce the friction in the workflow of geospatial data. Our leadership and investment led to the advancements of standards and tools that make archival data more accessible such as theSpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) and Analysis Ready Data. Our priorities in 2019 are equally ambitious. Not only will we expand the Radiant Earth platform’s functionality to enable large scale spatio-temporal analysis and integrate"

While there are some drawbacks to satellite images — they have a limited history and are often limited by cloud cover, for example — the USGS Landsat program allows us to see back in time at regular intervals since the 1980s."

NDSI compares visual and SWIR reflectance, as ice reflects lots of visible light and almost no SWIR light, in contrast with other types of land cover. NDSI uses the formula (VIS — SWIR)/(VIS + SWIR), which compares the visual reflectance to SWIR and then normalizes that value over the total amount of visible and SWIR reflectance. That normalization allows for comparison across time, meaning that we can do a change detection between the new and old images, using this formula:"

When subtracting the old NDSI value from the new NDSI value, any positive value means that there is added snow/ice cover and any negative value means that there is lost ice cover. In this case, negatives indicate lost glacier ice."

Notably, some the water and shadows are partly registering as ice in the 2018 image, appearing as the lighter blue. This is because, the difference in brightness overall is minimized in these areas, so the SWIR and Red parts of the spectrum are reflecting minimally."

Often combining innovative technological solutions to address local societal challenges, these social entrepreneurs are not only creating jobs. Their businesses are transforming all facets of society — from empowering women through education to creating alternative and affordable energy products. At 28 years and with a background in telecommunications, Ms. Thiam is a shining example of this African social entrepreneurial trend that uses new technologies for social change. She is building Lifantou, a collaborative web platform based on a geographic information system that connects food producers and school canteens in Senegal. Lifantou’s aim is to optimize the food procurement supply chains of schools to improve access to locally-produced agricultural goods. This will lower costs to schools and create an expanded market for local farmers to sell their wares. The vision that guides this effort is research showing that when schools provide daily meals to children, they learn better — a win-win for Senegal’s school-age children, schools and farmers alike!"

Кроме того, наши партнеры, разрабатывающие решения в области геомаркетинга, заинтересовались трафиком вокруг торговых центров, для потенциального рейтинга.Мы умеем создавать модели на основе нейросетей для распознавания изображений и применять их к данным съемки со спутников и аэрофотосъемки. Для того чтобы оценить заполненность парковок в Москве, мы создали сценарий моделей, распознающих площадные парковки и скопления машин на них."

Найти такой срез данных непросто, поскольку большая территория (~ 1400 км²) не покрывается одним пролетом. Мы используем платформу Digitalglobe для доступа к исходным данным и с ее помощью нашли нужное покрытие — съемка была поизведена в воскресный день лета, около 12 часов дня. С одной стороны — мы искали съемку за выходной день, потому что трафик распределен более равномерно по сравнению с маятниковыми колебаниями в рабочие дни, с другой — понятно, что в летние выходные народ валит из города и в среднем заполненность ниже. Но надо с чего-то начинать."

As an example, we completed a pilot project on pivot irrigated corn fields and elaborated its production costs which started out as a pioneering exercise for us. Corn is a water-intensive crop and water deficit during the growing season is a major factor limiting its production. In many irrigated fields, farmers are supplying the maximum amount of water required by corn to maximize production. This is increasing production costs(energy bill + fertilizer leaching) and has a negative impact on farm profitability. In many cases irrigation costs range between 200 and 1000 €/ha and irrigation is necessary because rainfall is insufficient to meet the crop water needs."

With several types of regional scale data being used currently, the use of Climate Engine by U.S. Drought Monitor authors, regulatory agencies, and ranchers and farmers adds local scale information for assessing field scale impacts — such as vegetative drought (short-term soil moisture deficits) and hydrologic drought (long-term water deficits and low river flows). The vegetation index anomaly map below is a nice example of how relatively high spatial resolution (30 m) Landsat satellite imagery can be used to monitor farmlands and rangelands at the same time. In this case, the map shows opposite signs of drought in 2015 across northwestern Nevada, where the rangelands were greener than average due to above average spring and summer rain and lower than average evaporative demand (as can be easily seen by looking at the Standardized Precipitation Index and Evaporative Demand Drought Index for the area), but the farmlands were fallow due to below average mountain snowpack for many years in a row and little to no water available in the river for diversion and surface water irrigation."

One of the common questions that managers and conservation scientists ask is if meadow restoration actually results in an increase in vegetation vigor. Field based assessments of the efficacy of meadow restoration require many years of observations both prior to and following restoration, and can be impractical and prohibitively expensive to implement across spatial scales. Alternatively, high-spatial resolution remote sensing products can provide an effective means of providing answers. Let’s take a quick look using Landsat and climate data.

There might be little missing clouds or over masking, but they considered negligible for the test. The manual mask is made by using QGIS program. After uploading the image to QGIS, a new layer is created on the image, and polygons are drawn by hand. To doublecheck the mask, a satellite map is installed under the image so that it was possible to compare the image with a non-cloudy map. It was done by adding WMS/WMTS layer. The challenging part is to draw masks of half transparent clouds on the image since there is no distinct border. After manual masking is done, the created layer is saved as binary ‘tif’ image. White parts are cloud mask, which means “1” in binary system; black parts are non-cloudy places on the image, which is “0”."

However, Sen2Cor is more successful in masking of half-transparent clouds. So for choosing the program you plan to use, it is significant to consider the type of cloud that needs to be filtered out. If there are mostly opaque clouds on the product, it would be better to use Fmask over three programs. In case of half-transparent cloudy products, Sen2Cor would be better to consider."

The latent heat release inside deep convective clouds plays a crucial role in several phenomena, e.g. the intensification of hurricanes and cyclones in general. Several studies have shown that DC and overshooting cloud tops penetrate the lowest stratosphere and allow the exchange of gases from the troposphere deep into the stratosphere."

Alternately, the script can be also used for monitoring water surface extend in (artificial) lakes or open reservoirs. It must be used only in multi-temporal processing with a fair number of samples (recommended 30). Value of data (VV, VH, etc.) varies strongly with satellite orbit in mountain areas. Therefore, the script might not be as useful as in flat or low hills areas. In addition, detection of flash floods is almost impossible as a result of resolution (10m) and time limit (usually maximum is only one image per day)."

That changed as in my final year, I signed up for modules in Earth Observation & GIS and was hooked! This led me to pursue a Masters in both where I was first exposed to Python but through choice stuck to ArcMap or ENVI as in short, they were easier to use. After graduation, I used GUI applications for years, until eventually I was confronted with a problem that had no way around it other than to program something bespoke. After much grumbling and moaning about the injustice of it all, I began to make my first tentative steps into Python."

Such collapsing will destroy the solar system. Where the movie becomes even more interesting is the solution it proposes to the mankind fate: moving the Earth planet from the solar system 300 years before its collapsing to another star system orbit… This movie provides the most realistic perspective about the future of the solar system and the probable or possible solution to the fate of the mankind.

According to the life cycle of the Sun, after 10 billion years, the Sun will become a read giant and then collapse in planetary nebulae before becoming a white dwarf. To avoid any destruction of the Earth from the end of the life cycle of the Sun; Earth should be removed from the solar system at last 2 billion years before the Sun becomes a red giant. If we consider that the Sun has already achieved half of its life cycle; from now to next 2 billion or 2.5 billion years; the mankind should have found an alternative solution to move from the solar system to escape its collapsing."

Giant gas planets, beginning by Jupiter, are equally a risk to Earth existence. If the Sun increases its size and mass; there will be a destabilization within the solar system that can lead to the merger of all giant gas planets. Such merger can produce another new star given that all of these giant gas planets are made of hydrogen (more than 75% to 90% of their composition)."

There are stars far smaller than the size of Saturn. A thermonuclear activation that leads to the hydrogen fusion within a giant gas planets would drastically increase their mass and transform them into stars. Change in the speed and acceleration of their gravitational patterns is one of the events that can set up the process of their transformation into stars.

However although their differences of distance to the sun, Mercure and Mars are quite similar planets in size. If scientists can provide evidence of past existence of water and oceans on Mars; it means that Mars orbit distance in the past was probably in the habitable zone around 150 million km from the Sun. If this assumption is true; this validates the idea that Earth was at that time more likely like Venus today. Does the Sun evolution vary in a cycle of contraction & expansion of its size and mass that would make planets’ orbits changing following such cycle? If yes, it can explain Mars, Earth and Venus respective evolution and changes."

Since then, the first results have emerged. In 4 different workgroups focusing on different Earth Observation (EO) domains, a total of more than 500 new EO concepts are identified. Added to the already existing Geospatial Information (GI) concepts, this will result in a Body of Knowledge containing around 1000 concepts. In the next years the EO4GEO partners, together with a growing network of experts, will elaborate on these concepts, clearly defining them and linking to papers and articles with more background information. Furthermore learning outcomes will be defined for each concept and the relation between the different concepts will be detailed. From the beginning of June the network of experts is gradually more involved in this work and the first concepts are completely detailed."

Therefore EO4GEO is still expanding its network of experts. This is done by organizing or participating in high level events where we meet these experts and explain the project. One of such events is the EO Summit organized in Leuven at the end of June, in parallel with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Technical Committee meeting at the same location. This gave EO4GEO the opportunity to learn about the standardisation work done by OGC in numerous geospatial domains, while OGC experts learned about the different aspects of the EO4GEO project and they were invited to collaborate on the EO4GEO BoK. More information about the OGC Tc and the EO Summit can be found in the OGC blog. Interested experts in the Earth Observation/ Geographical Information Sectors are invited to contribute joining our network of experts."

But Earth observation and Geospatial Information is more and more used in other domains (agriculture, climate change, disaster management, smart cities, etc.) and techniques from other domains are integrated in the EO world (Artificial Intelligence is a good example). Therefore it is a must to link our BoK to bodies of knowledge defined in other domains. A first set of such BoKs were identified and options to link to them were examined. By combining information of different BoKs the value of the information greatly expands. This is a clear example where 1 + 1 is greater than 2."

Occupational profiles are the knowledge, skills and competencies required for fulfilling tasks related to a specified job. One source of information about occupational profiles are job advertisements. In this respect, Gruijthuijsen et al. (2019) [1] performed an analysis of the skills and competencies required for certain occupational profiles in the EO/GI sector. They used profiles mentioned in ESCO, the European multilingual classification of Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (European Union, 2017) [2] as starting point for searching for job advertisements in the business oriented platform LinkedIn and analysed the skills and competencies required by potential applications."

This study started with the collection of duties and tasks of the profile of a remote sensing (RS) specialist by a group of experts following the ‘design a curriculum approach’ (DACUM). Once duties and tasks were documented, the required skill levels to complete the tasks and expected effects of trends in the sector were mapped to the tasks. This led to an illustration of tasks, which are expected to change, as shown in Figure 1 (Hofer et al. 2019)."

The identification of this core can support the design of training programmes at a later stage in the project. To make progress on that point, the approach developed by Hofer et al. (2019) has been implemented by 12 EO4GEO partners, who contributed a total of 16 occupational profiles. This was the starting point for a combined analysis of these profiles — where a subset of 11 profiles was analysed, which focused on analysis and research work in GIS and RS rather than education or sales. The detailed analysis of these 11 profiles is documented in a Github repository."

Business processes are thereby illustrating the steps from an idea to a final product given a specific use case. Actually, there are a set of coordinated activities, initiated in response to an event, conducted by both people and equipment, in order to achieve a specific result for the stakeholder of the process. The idea behind this approach is that business processes show workflows of tasks that workforce needs to master in their daily work; in addition, business processes show who is involved in projects and needs to communicate with one another, and how the information is interrelated in order to obtain an output."

These two pieces of input provide the basis for developing curricula that are adapted to the needs of workforce with different occupational profiles; profiles that range from having some basic knowledge about EO/GI to being an expert on EO/GI service development. Serving a variety of occupational profiles leads to a variety of curricula that will cover vocational training, re-skilling of existing workforce and academic education. The challenge regarding curriculum design will be to translate the skills needs into curricula with an appropriate structure and adapted learning materials. But before anticipating future steps of the project, here a short overview on the status-quo of business process modeling in EO4GEO."

Information like reference data provided, context and narrative description of the use case, data used, output, next steps reflect important details on each business process. More than that, the modelling language, which has been agreed in the project, is Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), used to document the details of how a process operates, as a visual representation of a work. These models show who is involved in the process, their interactions and the workflow from activity to activity.

Writing a decoder by hand for one of 26 different record shapes sounded tedious. It might as well have been an invitation to throw up our hands and toss unparsed JSON values around.

Romania is now in the land consolidation phase. When farmers discover an arable field waiting to be bought or leased, they just grab it. After they buy it, they check its service history, evaluate the quality of the farming that it went through and then decide on the next steps."

Managing and extracting value from this data poses a range of technical challenges. Working with our friends at Sinergise and the European Space Agency’s phi-lab, we are building a toolset for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to satellite imagery at scale and in near real-time. This post demonstrates a method for rapid classification of land use and land cover (LULC) on Sentinel data. We accomplish this using Sentinel Hub, eo-learn, fastai, and our chip-n-scale prediction tools. To enable this workflow, we built a new utility, fastai-serving, that enables you to scale predictions on the cloud."

Images and data cover the planet daily, and some programs have been collecting data for decades, providing value for understanding and tracking climate change, urban growth, power and transport availability, agricultural production, and much more. The volume, velocity, complexity, and sheer size of this data is more than humans can handle. AI is a critical tool for getting value from this data and makes it actionable. AI helps us to track rapidly evolving natural disasters, rapidly map power infrastructure, and to cheaply analyze decades of imagery to determine the impact of special economic zones."

Her full walkthrough describes how to train a land use segmentation algorithm using only a single date of observation. This approach is often quicker and cheaper than alternative approaches that use data from multiple points in time. Multitemporal approaches can better account for noise and clouds and tend to do much better at distinguishing between certain agricultural and vegetation areas. Sinergise has demonstrated a great example of using multitemporal land-use classification using eo-learn.

Sometimes it is valuable to trade a small amount of accuracy for a much faster and less expensive result. This might be the case when scaling over a very large area, when doing initial exploration and hypothesis testing, or when responding to certain rapid onset disaster situations. Using less data and limited hyperparameter tuning allows for faster iterations while developing a model. Predictions on a single date are also valuable tracking land use change within a season. Urchn uses regular land use assessments as one input to flag areas where the map may be out of date."

We use eo-learn to compute three band combinations (NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI) that carry good signal for Land Use and substitute these in place of the RGB channels. The `eo-learn` framework also served as the primary data acquisition and transformation framework prior to the data being used in `fastai`."

In this case, we wanted to run our model over all of Slovenia in order to compare with the previous Sinergise model. Our standard approach for this type of problem is to use “chip-n-scale”. Chip-n-scale relies on having the model as a TensorFlow Serving Image. It was difficult to convert our model to this format, so we sought an alternative way to run this framework on `fastai` models. We released this work as fastai-serving: an API for running `fastai` models with the same API as TensorFlow serving (but without replicating the underlying functionality)."

Because of the inherent variability using a single date, our model is more susceptible to noise or clouds, and has a lower overall accuracy score (85% vs 94% pixels correctly labeled). We are happy with that result. We believe that the time and cost savings are a reasonable tradeoff in certain situations."

Relying merely on reflectance values of selected spectral bands was not an option in our case, as we needed to handle variability in the number of time frames of the input, which should not be expected to be consistent. Instead, additional multi-temporal features had to be extracted with some sort of statistical feature aggregation."

Clouds tend to be more reflective than the surfaces they cover, hence taking the maximum might not be very useful, as it should pool the clouds from all of the time frames into a single cloudy image. The minimum and mean, on the other hand, ought to help approximate a cloudless image, which is ideal for comparison with the target frame. Both values can be deceiving, however: the image of minima can be marred by shadows and the mean is highly dependant on (the lack of) cloud presence in the frames."

For example, the maximum difference between the target frame and every other is simply the difference between the target frame and the timewise minimum image, excluding the target frame itself. Adding these statistics to the features might, therefore, be seen as redundant, yet even such slight pre-processing can be of aid to the classifier."

Comparing the pixel neighbourhoods of multiple time frames should be informative in this regard and is in fact used in MAJA already. After a sequence of criteria, MAJA computes the correlation of neighbourhoods for each potential detection and if a large enough correlation is observed, the detection is rejected."

While it can be used as a metric that “describes how well the two images X and Y correlate over an area of N by N pixels”, the correlation it observes is linear."

The Pearson coefficient should, thus, work as expected only in the case of clouds with sufficiently variable reflectance in the considered window (pixel neighbourhood) and as such might not carry the most meaningful information."

This is useful as it can highlight where the algorithm is failing or performing particularly well. It should be noted that the samples in Hollstein’s data set are part of only several thousand polygons, hand-drawn over mostly uniform objects. What this means is that it effectively covers only a handful of regions and the achieved results may not generalise as expected."

We may have avoided having an insufficient number of samples and an irregular representation of diverse geographic areas, but using machine annotated data has its trade-offs. Inevitable noise in the data can perhaps be discarded, however, certain biases of the original algorithm (MAJA) that tend to consistently mislabel the samples are bound to affect the training and manifest in our results as well."

We were reluctant to let go of positive results, produced by these previous efforts, by switching over to an algorithm that is, in fact, more complex. For that reason, we considered tapping directly into s2cloudless’ predictive capabilities."

This meant that we could use a simple intersection of predictions: practically all of the legitimate clouds, detected by the multi-temporal classifier, should be detected by s2cloudless as well, while false positives can be rejected due to either of the classifiers."

In these examples, the clouds are expected to be practically random and therefore should not accumulate in any particular part of the image. As such, one would expect to see an image of ratios that is mostly uniform.

Successful workshops on use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (drones) and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) are examples of this. As the recently appointed chair of the society’s Education and Training committee I have been set the task to look at new ways in which the society can contribute to the uptake of EO/RS skills in the wider community. This ranges from promoting EO/RS related activities in primary schools through to CPD for people already working in the field.

RasterFrames, our open-source toolkit, allows us to process EO data in a DataFrame for the first time. Backed by Apache Spark, RasterFrames brings a very mature parallel compute capability to this inherently big data. The rest of this post explains some basics about EO data and how, until now, it has been tied up in specialized tools. We will show how RasterFrames aligns with and enhances exciting trends to enable data scientists to easily find valuable data, focus on higher-level abstractions, and ignore many of the idiosyncrasies of how EO data are published by satellite operators."

Let’s unpack that bit of jargon. Geospatial rasters are typically overhead images or measurements of the Earth’s surface: from cameras or telescopes aboard satellites, aircraft, or drones. Raster means that measurements are organized as an image, where the pixel values can represent just about any measurable phenomenon: such as temperature, elevation, plant health, etc. Geospatial means that the image is tied to a location. We sometimes also see the term spatiotemporal to emphasize that the data has both place and time of its capture."

EO data providers published the data for scientists and had to balance factors like spatial coverage and high data compression. For those users, searching and downloading files was a key part of the legacy workflow. Users had to choose carefully and download as few of these 50 to 100 megapixel files as feasible. That was an acceptable condition when studying a well-defined phenomenon in a specific region and time."

Training a model in the cloud (x2 Graphics Processing Units (GPU) k80 with Tensorflow/Keras and multi-GPU training, for those who are in the know) takes around one day.

Both were looking for a new way to apply their skills. Slava, a programmer, had been fond of aerial drone photography for several years. Usevalad, a GIS expert, worked in the agricultural sector. As a result of this meeting, Usevalad and Slava started working for farmers — Slava would take pictures from a drone and Usevalad would make maps for the differentiated application of fertilisers based on the analysis. The demand for the service was growing, and it became clear that processing this information required automation, and accordingly, extension of their know-how."

Landsat, Modis and Copernicus were identified as the three candidates of data sources for OneSoil. Copernicus won this race mainly thanks to three decisive advantages. Firstly, Copernicus offers a significantly higher spatial resolution: 10 m vs. 30 m for Landsat, thus enabling analysis at field level. Secondly, use of its data is completely free, and finally Copernicus offers more frequent data updates by having two identical satellites working on opposite sides of the orbit. As such the Sentinel-1 mission achieves its global coverage in just six days while Sentinel-2 has a revisit time of 2–5 days depending on the latitude."

A total of 250 Tb of data was processed, covering Europe and the USA. We pre-processed the images by removing the clouds, shadows and snow. We then compressed the data down to 50 Tb. In a quick calculation, approximately 140Tb of raw data (we used float32 data at the inference stage) was passed through the GPU. Following this, we searched for field boundaries and classified cultures with our Machine Learning algorithms. This produced approximately 250Gb of vector maps with field geometries and cultures."

A full set of tiles is created for each zoom level and stored in a tree-based file structure that allows users to zoom and pan a map. This approach requires you to pre-generate a tile tree consisting of millions of files. With a COG you can use internal overviews to create multiple zooms and internal tiles to stand in for map tiles, and thus, only have one file to manage for a large area. We call this process ""dynamic tiling"" because we access the raw data (e.g. surface reflectance or elevation) and then apply algorithms on it before creating the tile to display in the browser."

Of those, MobileNetV2 [7] is among the smallest and most comparable in this regard. It comes pre-trained on ImageNet for various input sizes, but not for 64x64 pixels, the size of EuroSAT images. Therefore, the data was upscaled to 128x128 pixels, for which size the corresponding model weights were at hand.

This work on the release began in earnest during the 5th STAC Sprint that took place in early November. Having everyone in person enabled us to discuss all the major issues remaining, and we managed to get to decisions on all of them and got to at least draft pull requests of each. The last couple of months have been spent refining those and getting all the little details right, including two ‘release candidates’ — drafts that the community could give feedback on. You can see the full list of improvements in the changelog, and I’ll detail the highlights below."

This was done for two major reasons. The first is to better share common fields — for example, we had sar:constellation and sar:platform in the SAR extension, and eo:constellation and eo:platform in the EO extension. These mean the same thing but have different prefixes and thus less interoperability. The second reason is to help highlight the most used fields by putting them in the same folder as the item specification, as a new part of the specification called Common Metadata."

The view extension came about from a great discussion about capture angles in aerial imagery, after the first release candidate.

The most common is an epsg code, which was previously in the EO extension, but clearly has much wider applicability. We also added a number of options for people who want to include more projection information in their STAC record or are working with data that does not have defined EPSG codes. These include a WKT2 string, a PROJ4 or even the new PROJJSON object. The extension also adds the ability to include a bounding box or centroid in the native projection of the object, in addition to the WGS-84 definition that GeoJSON requires."

The core specification is quite simple, with just two fields: ‘version’ and ‘deprecated’. It then uses RFC 5829 for ‘latest-version’, ‘predecessor-version’ and ‘successor-version’ relation types. The extension does not specify the versioning practices, so it can be used in almost any scheme, but there is a new section on Versioning for Catalogs in the best practices document. Also added for 0.9.0 is a complementary Items and Collections API Version Extension, which provides the REST endpoints to request particular versions, or all versions, along with the link relations between them."

It was the first time we had a real critical mass of people who had built STAC API’s at a sprint, so there were a lot of good exchanges resulting in concrete progress. A lot of thinking went into all the mechanics of our Query, and since we were sprinting with the OGC Features API (OAFeat) community we worked to align with their standard."

It does not exactly align with OAFeat right now, as they put just numberReturned and numberMatched at the root level of the JSON object. We hope to propose changing those to align with the context object that can hopefully be reused as a common component with other OGC specifications."

We added a GET version of sort, and aligned the semantics with the ‘sortby’ term that has been commonly used in OGC standards. The new OGC API has not yet specified their sort protocol, but we talked extensively with the core contributors of Features and Records, and hope they can adopt our proposal."

So the next release will be 1.0-beta, which means that we are pretty sure that what we have is ready to go 1.0, but we want to do one more round of feedback where we have the license to change things. Our goal after the beta release is to get as many organizations to adopt STAC as possible, getting to numerous software tools, lots of datasets and hopefully billions of STAC items. And hopefully from diverse domains as well, pushing our extensions in different directions to ensure that the core is flexible enough to adapt. We’ll be setting some clear, measurable targets for adoption and will go to 1.0.0 final after we reach them."

We’ll have to re-orient the specifications and indeed the website as well for this, but it should help provide more clarity. It will hopefully be a major community effort. And we still are welcome new collaborators all the time, stop by our gitter chat and say hi, and start using STAC to catalog all your assets! And a big thanks to everyone who got us this far, we could not have done it without the incredible community of contributors."

The valley encompasses the following lakes: lake Ziway, lake Langano, lake Abijatta and lake Shala. The wetland ecosystem is a biodiversity hotspot for both flora and fauna containing lots of bird species and water plants. Floriculture, horticulture and viticulture are the main activities in the area whilst the area is used as a source for drinking water. However, poverty and land degradation are quickly increasing threatening agricultural practices and local fisheries. Unsustainable land and water management e.g. pollution, land degradation, deforestation and over-abstraction lead to decreasing water quantities and qualities. The central rift valley is of significant economic, ecological and social importance. Therefore, IDH (the sustainable trade initiative) set up a project to improve land and water management to increase livelihood and decrease land degradation."

In the following sections an environmental baseline (see blog post 4) of the study area is set up only using online viewing services (no GIS software environment needed). Both the advantages and disadvantages of the datasets are shown. Relevant open source earth observation datasets that can help as a tool for mitigation and adaptation strategies to the aforementioned problems are given."

Tree cover is defined by the GFW as vegetation higher than 5 meters and a canopy density of >30%. Both tree cover gain and losses are visible on the map. The tree cover gain is mostly scattered over the eastern part of the study area. Tree cover loss is visible in clear deforested patches in the densely forested areas. The maps of the GFW should be used with caution, for example tree cover gain can simply indicate vegetation growth. Tree cover loss can also be the result of a rotation scheme or show a tree plantation. Therefore, it is always important to validate the maps with ground truth information."

It is visible that most of the images contain white patches, these patches are clouds. The time series shows how difficult it can be to analyze for example seasonal NDVI changes because it is simply to cloudy. However, seasonal changes are still visible. Some time steps contain much dark green areas (higher NDVI levels) while other time steps contain more light green areas (lower NDVI levels)."

Both the locations of the lakes and the borders of Ethiopia were added inside the worldview portal. The spatial resolution of the elevation dataset is 30 meter and can both be viewed and downloaded for further analysis. We did not take time series of elevation levels into account since they are relatively stable over long periods of time with the exception of erosion and tectonic activity. It is visible that the central rift valley is above sea levels and is enclosed by two larger plateau’s in the north-west and east.

However, the combination of the information in the datasets are more valuable. Lake Abijatta is drying out but the SPEI map (giving information about evaporation and precipitation) shows that both dry and wet episodes have occurred. This suggests that drought is not solely the blame, unsustainable water management might have added to the problem as well."

The dataset has a spatial resolution of 300 meters and can be downloaded and viewed in the ESA CCI viewer. By analyzing the datasets through time it becomes clear that the urban areas (red) in the central rift valley have grown.

An example of this is that hardly any deforestation is visible on ESA’s land cover map. This can be due to the resolution or classification methods. The maps derived from the global forest watch show that there were indeed deforested areas in the central rift valley."

Information about the protected areas is stored within a shapefile and can be accessed via the online viewer. The protected area around the lake is called Abijatta-Shalla and is designated as a national park since 1963. Despite the protections lake Abijatta is still prone to bad water management suggesting that the measurements taken to protect the area are not enough. The eastern part of the study area is largely a controlled hunting area and covers the most densely forested areas. The protected area next to lake Langano and below Kersa is called Munesa-Shashemene and is a designated national forest priority area. The global forest watch imagery shows that the forest priority area is still prone to deforestation. Ground truth information about the cause of the deforestation is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the protected area. It might be possible that the deforested areas are part of a tree plantation or rotation scheme.

The amount of soil organic carbon is important because they are correlated to the productive capacity of the land. The soil organic carbon map below shows some small differences in carbon storage. The middle part of the study area next to the lakes have relatively low carbon stocks while the areas in the north-west and east have higher carbon stocks. The eastern part of the study area is more densely vegetated (see global forest watch map) than the areas with lower carbon stocks. Carbon stock maps can be of importance when planning specific land uses.

As visible on the map below the central rift valley has a rich biodiversity with monkeys, a variety of bird species and water plants. It should be kept in mind that the GBIF database is built on human sightings and therefore not all areas are equally sampled. Areas that are easily accessible usually contain much more sightings than inaccessible areas e.g. steep mountains and areas without roads. However, the database can be used to get a broad overview of the biodiversity in the area of interest."

The images below show that some fires occurred during the fire season of 2019. Burned areas are more susceptible to fires than areas that have never burned before. Therefore, the burned areas dataset can be of interest when implementing fire control measures. The dataset can also be used to monitor active fires in near-real time."

For me, this is very encouraging. It can be difficult to balance the expectations society has of you as a woman, with the desire and passion you may have for your career. Really, a more inclusive workplace should be beneficial for everyone, no matter how they choose to balance their life and career. The issues around this can be complex, and engrained in practices not just here but the world over, so it’s really vital we have those supportive networks to allow us all to thrive."

For me, I think the best approaches organisations can take are to critically analyse the current situation and to consider where any inequalities are being perpetuated and people may not have realised. Many business practices - hiring, health care provision, promotion, working hours, transport/facilities - can have gendered elements that can be overlooked by accident. A critical thing is to give a diversity of people the opportunity to raise issues that affect them and include those perspectives when decisions are made. I think organisations can also take a role in the wider systems that influence who works for them eventually, i.e., by supporting school and university level outreach. We’re doing a lot of great work towards that at EUMETSAT and it’s great!"

Organisations can do this and raise the profile of the women in their organisations and in others that they work with. This can help change stereotypes, give other women role models, and show women they are valued and recognised for their contributions. I really like when organisations run accounts that are guest hosted, or do things like ‘Ask me anything’ sessions - so you can really hear from and interact with people directly. Organisations can also speak openly about what they are doing towards equality - I’ve always found it really encouraging to hear about initiatives that have been put in place to address the challenges that people from different underrepresented groups face."

From my experience this is an excellent framework for helping to address issues around inequality, and I learnt a lot of how to question things from perspectives beyond my own. The process involved a lot of work assessing the current status within the organisation (women in different roles, promotion, policies around caring responsibilities, hiring practice, harassment levels etc.), so that areas that needed improvement could be identified and we could quantify meaningful impact. Even just acknowledging the situation as it was, made women in the organisation feel heard, and we really started to make rapid progress. We all undertook unconscious bias testing, and there were regular coffee mornings held on certain topics which helped us identify a range of small and larger things we could try and address to improve situations for women (and often men) in the workplace too."

For decades researchers have utilized space-based sensors to survey proxy variables and create forecasts of diseases. The importance of weather conditions and landscapes to determine habitats for disease vectors have been investigated in various impressive studies. But what about detecting the symptoms of an outbreak?

He created a map to cluster cases of cholera, allowing him to determine a water pump as the disease’s source. The outbreak was already in decline and practical consequences might have been slim, yet, theoretical implications of the study are uncontested and considered a major step toward modern epidemiology. As a combination of maps and medicine, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that to this day geographers might on occasion proclaim ownership of the epidemiological sub-discipline."

This term originated in the field of finance, but as well found its way into domains such as modern medicine. In a broader sense, it describes the repurposing of data outside the subject area to derive insight. Alternative data often comes with a geolocation, and moreover, being agnostic of application domains, satellite images are a prime example of alternative data. Hence, since Corona is heavily associated with medicine and finance alike, and since satellite images are a popular source of alternative data, the following is a quick glimpse into how to “diagnose” a virus of subcellular size from space, using free data and a pixel resolution of 10 meters."

Data is in theory collected within a six day repeat interval. The ground resolution can roughly be expressed to be 10 by 10 meters. SAR satellites are only weakly affected by clouds and atmosphere overall, contributing to a guaranteed acquisition window defined by the repeat pass. Ignoring the complex characteristics of data acquisition and preprocessing, note that different surfaces have different reflective properties, which in the end cause different intensities in the generated images. Plain surfaces generally scatter back weakly, while surfaces which are rough or perpendicular to the beam scatter back strongly. Black shadows exist due to the side looking acquisition geometry of SAR. For our concrete application note that due to sporadically distributed metallic objects, an industrially occupied area causes a stronger signal than blank empty ground."

For each pixel we derive median and maximum values for the associated time windows of each year separately. We hereby lose the intra-annual information of the windows, yet since our goal is a colorful illustration of the differences between years, this can be disregarded. Finally, data from each year is associated with a certain color: 2018 — red, 2019 — green, 2020 — blue. Dark grey is associated with low backscatter over all years, while red, green, and yellow are comparably low backscatter in 2020. Blue, on the contrary, implies a lot of scattering in 2020 alone."

Open areas associated with manufacturing or logistics are absent of blue color, indicating absence of objects for the year 2020. Wuhan is among others known to host several car manufacturers, which is reflected by various car compounds. Such compounds can be found in different areas of the city, generally appearing in yellowish colors, indicating high presence of activity for the years 2018 and 2019, yet few activity in 2020. Areas that are blue are mainly associated with buildings and construction activities. This implies buildings, which have not been present at the beginning of 2018 or 2019, yet which have been finished over the course of 2019. Such areas generally cause an increased backscatter over previously open or sparsely vegetated sites."

Focusing on the left part of the Figure, which illustrates the development of median values at the beginning of 2018 (red), 2019 (green), and 2020 (blue), ship objects appear to be present only on the left sidearm, and only in the year 2020. The other side of the Figure illustrates maximum values for the same time frames. Contrarily, heavy ship traffic is indicated especially for the right sidearm, and the high presence of red, green, and yellow indicates a relatively low ship occurrence in 2020. To interpret this, let’s formulate an assumption on what median values mean in the context of ship traffic. Considering the existence of multiple scenes, it is highly probable that non-dark median values imply ships, which have been stationary for extended periods of time. Therefore, patterns on the left side of the Figure indicate increased anchoring in 2020. Following the same logic, the right side shows many sporadic occurrences objects due to many particularly high maximum values, and hence clearly illustrates traffic of the Yangtze being strongly decreased since the outbreak, due to the prevalence especially of red and green blips."

But these data can help dealing with an inverse task: to assess the degree of economic activity of a territory by the level of pollution measured from space. For many years, a significant problem has been the study of the relationship between human well-being and the measured environmental characteristics. Each of these parameters can respond differently to social and economic phenomena. Therefore, their study should be as comprehensive as possible. Some links between indicators of economic activity and the environment, for example, were presented in a 1995 American article comparing per capita income with urban air pollution, oxygen conditions, and pollution of river basins with feces and heavy metals.⁶ However, the lack of data has always limited the scope of any such research."

If you look at point measurements of NO₂ density in individual cities below, you can see an atypical seasonal drop. Note that the maximum concentration of NO₂ happens during the winter, which is partly due to adverse weather conditions preventing self-cleaning of the atmosphere, and accompanied by maximum emissions of thermal power stations. The seasonality of nitrogen dioxide levels is especially noticeable in such large industrial centers as Milan, Verona, and Vicenza. But they all share an unusual drastic decline at the end of February 2020, which corresponds to the time series of maps provided above."

BIM not only affects the constructive process, but also the final outcome: coming buildings and infrastructures are containing a huge amount of data regarding usage, maintenance, relations with their environment, etc. Since smart cities are becoming reality, the necessity to deal with big data is continuously growing. In the same way, Geographic information and geo-localization are becoming increasingly important in many fields. GIS is already a reality in our industry, starting to be used by Public Administrations for many purposes. Geo-localization is becoming more and more important in civil works, being used for example to drive machinery for road construction."

We are facing uncertain scenarios, new technologies are arising continuously and no matter what we plan, future will be different. We are sure that everything is going to change, but we don’t know how and where to. This is an enormous challenge that demands permanent collaboration between stakeholders from many countries, since the smallest innovation thousand miles from our country will strongly affect us in a couple of months. Continuous effort to detect innovation and to foresee its impact is fundamental, not only within our industry but also from a more comprehensive perspective, since every single change in whatever other sector may critically influence us."

Platform tools form a first layer of tools, with direct access to the BoK and capable of visualizing (BoK Visualizer), searching (Find in BoK) and editing (Living Textbook) the BoK. These tools are mainly aimed at project partners and collaborating experts who build the BoK. The second layer of tools consists of the BoK end user tools, which are logically aimed at the main stakeholders that use the BoK, i.e., practitioners of the educational and commercial sector of the EO/GI fields. Examples of such end user tools developed in the EO4GEO project include the Curriculum Design Tool for the educational sector, the Occupational Profile Tool and the Job Offer Tool for the commercial sector, and the BoK Matching Tool which bridges and serves both. We elaborate on each of those tools next."

Each of these elements are composable (e.g., a study program for a university may consist of various modules, which in turn consist of various courses) or may be specified independently (i.e., a vocational and education training course may consist of a single course). The designer can create any of these elements from scratch, or choose to browse and re-use existing elements. As such, lectures may for example be re-used in various vocational training courses, or modules may be re-used in various study programs. The CDT offers a graphical view, showing an overview of the created educational elements, and a textual view showing and allowing to enter detailed information, such as descriptions, ECTS credits, learning objectives, pre-requisites, etc. Once finished, various possibilities are available to share and export the created content in different formats (e.g., as a link, pdf, …)."

First of all, the CDT provides a graphical view on the BoK, which the designer can search and browse. This grants him access to the domain knowledge of the field, and allows him to re-use this knowledge during the design. For example, descriptions of BoK concepts can be re-used or adapted as lecture descriptions, and BoK skills can be used as learning outcomes. Secondly, the CDT allows to link BoK concepts to study programs, modules, courses or lectures, thereby formally describing them and grounding them in the BoK."

The OPT offers the designer a graphical view on the Body of Knowledge, which allows him to browse to and select the relevant BoK concepts (knowledge) and skills to associate to a profile. In addition, transversal skills (e.g., able to lead a team), originating from the European Commission promoted ESCO list, can be specified. Other European standards are used to specify the expertise level (European Qualification Framework) and the application domain (CEDEFOP training fields). Finally, an occupational profile is finished with a title and description (free text). As for the Curriculum Design Tool, the created profile can be shared and exported in different formats (e.g., as a link, pdf, …), and visualized using the OPT, including visual cues that overview the knowledge and skill distribution among different knowledge areas in the BoK — see Figure 3."

The JOT provides the same graphical view on the BoK as the other tools, which allows to search for and browse the knowledge and skills available in the BoK, and add them as required to a job offer.

Here, the advantage of using the Body of Knowledge as a shared, formally described vocabulary, which grounds the resources created by the various EO4GEO tools, becomes apparent: it allows to match and compare any resource with respect to knowledge and skills. For example, a job offer may be compared with a study program of a candidate, hereby determining which percentage of knowledge and skills he/she possesses that is required for the job, or determining which vocational training course they need to offer to complement his/her knowledge or skills."

It was great to work with a company like Planet that is focused on making satellite data visible, accessible and actionable for the masses. By working with them, we were able to iterate much faster to create a model that is good for our users as well as for the data provider and their partners.

As I began this unexpected journey, I developed a keen interest for Earth Observation (EO), the domain of space that deals with satellites that monitor the Earth and generate a lot of data leading to some insights that I did not associate with space before. I was amazed and found this to be revolutionary. I did not know you can monitor changes on Earth over time and visualise that from space. I did not know you can use satellite images from the night to calculate economic growth models based on “night lights”. I did not know you can use data from satellites and count the cars in parking lots to provide input to consumer spending models. This timing of my interest into EO also coincided with the growing EO sector, with hundreds of satellites being launched every year, meaning petabytes of data was being collected every day. So, I am not entirely surprised that we see more satellite imagery around us than ever before in the news media, even from Donald Trump."

Thankfully, my daily job involved doing a similar type of evangelisation for the project I have been involved in, called “Insights from Space.” As a result, I got a lot of interest from people from the non-EO community who were surprised to know about all this and wanted to know more.

Do you want data downloaded from satellites real-time or do you want to use archived imagery? And finally, what is your budget — if you want to use free data, there are a few ways of doing that and if you want to buy satellite data, there are a bunch of companies that provide different types of data to solve different problems.

Although an “Amazon for EO data” does not exist yet, some start-ups are taking this path — Airbus’ Up42, Astraea, SkyWatch, Arlula, Maxar’s GBDX & Google Earth Engine, to name a few. However, the lack of interest from some satellite data providers in the marketplace model coupled with the complexity in sorting out the already complex satellite imagery business models, makes this approach challenging. Still, I remain very enthusiastic about this direct approach. I hope, sometime in the future, there will be an Android-like framework for EO data, where one can get access to different types satellite data (and possibly other types of data), develop various sorts of applications and release them into an EO app-store (like a Google Play)."

This is exactly what companies such as Orbital Insight, Descartes Labs, SpaceKnow and Ursa Space Systems offer. They extract data from satellites, combine that with other sources of data and offer answers to some key questions. Some companies such as BlackSky are taking this route from the scratch, and many other data providers are also jumping on this bandwagon. This approach simplifies the business model (almost SaaS-like) and does not require interested parties to fully understand what spatial resolution, spectral resolution and revisit time mean. However, different parties require different answers and the challenge is in identifying these key scalable use cases."

Perhaps, interested parties do not need to know much about EO data, they just want answers to questions. EO data could be just one of the types of data used to build models that could help in answering the big questions for organisations. As far as the consultancies and advisory firms justify these costs, the customers are happy and they do not have to get into the complexities I described above. Organisations might just choose to outsource this part to consultancies and advisory firms, and trust them in doing the right thing for them. Would this approach increase the use of EO data exponentially? Probably not, but at least it could be used in circumstances that fit well, with the right approach."

Maybe there will not be so many choices in front of us, both for video streaming and for EO. Maybe there will be an aggregator service (a single-point-solution) for video streaming. In the case of EO, perhaps the business model and value proposition will become easy enough to explain in one slide and the uptake will rapidly improve. OR, it could also be the case that none of this is a big deal. People will continue to subscribe to all video streaming services and maybe the use of EO data will grow organically, by continuing status quo and things will be figured out. As for now, I think I want to watch some comedy, so I am going to go search for interesting shows on Netflix, Amazon, Disney and HBO."

To deal with the massive amounts of data, the WaCoDiS project aims to develop an architecture that allows its automated processing. The project focuses on the development of innovative water management analytics services based on Earth Observation data such as provided by the Copernicus Sentinel missions."
Event-driven Processing of Earth Observation Data,https://medium.com/52-north-network/event-driven-processing-of-earth-observation-data-1a930eb29317?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,https://medium.com/@FiveTwoN,Medium,3,"Water management associations currently face different challenges regarding the quality control of drinking water. More frequently, they have to deal with pollutant inputs into surface waters. Reasons for this are increased fertilization of agricultural areas and extreme weather events, which, in particular, lead to nitrate leaching. In order to develop case specific strategies for reducing pollutant inputs, the development of an improved water monitoring is needed. The broader availability of Earth Observation data as well as the evolution of different Copernicus satellite data platforms, such as the Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform — Deutschland (CODE-DE), contribute to this task. Innovative analytic services can use those platforms’ processing capabilities to operate on Big Earth Observation Data in order to provide different Earth Observation products for a hydrologic application context. WaCoDiS aims to develop such a monitoring system for the Wupper region in North-Rhine Westfalia, Germany. This is the project’s area of study. The Wupperverband is the water authority responsible for a 813 km² catchment area and operates several river dams and sewage treatment plants. The goal is to improve hydrological models including, but not limited to, a) identification of the catchment areas responsible for pollutant and sediment inputs, b) detection of turbidity sources in water bodies and rivers."

Therefore the WaCoDiS System comprises dedicated components. Each one is responsible for a specific task within a processing workflow that automatically generates Earth Observation products. The entire processing workflow is depicted in Figure 1 and described as follows."

The user only needs to define what product type he demands for which area and temporal extent. The scheduling system handles this description by executing each single task so that the user receives the product needed at the of the whole processing workflow. Thus, the system reduces manual work (e.g. identification of relevant input data, execution of algorithms) and minimizes the required interaction of domain users. In addition, once a Processing Job is registered within the system, the user can track its status (e.g. when it was last executed, if an error occurred) and will eventually be informed when new processing results are available."

This allows for a flexible scaling and deployment of the system. For example, the management components can run on different physical locations than the processing algorithms. New processing algorithms can be also easily integrated using the OGC Web Processing Service Interface."
Event-driven Processing of Earth Observation Data,https://medium.com/52-north-network/event-driven-processing-of-earth-observation-data-1a930eb29317?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,https://medium.com/@FiveTwoN,Medium,9,"A first priority was the design of a component architecture to consider deployment in native cloud environments. The Microservice pattern serves this well and allows for elasticity and scalability aspects in the system. All components are available as Docker images and are configurable to meet the deployment environment’s requirement. The different functional modules (e.g. persistence layer, scheduling, process execution) are fully decoupled. Therefore, the system can be deployed in Platform as a Service (PaaS) environments, such as the Copernicus DIAS nodes, or on Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS), e.g. Google Cloud Platform or AWS (see Figure 3), as well as on a local or bare metal server. Our proof of concept comprised an installation on a vanilla Kubernetes cluster. During the remainder of the project, we will install the system on the CODE-DE platform (also considering the current re-launch and its native APIs) and on GCP premises. The Message Broker establishes all communication between the components, thus enabling their distributed deployment. This is of particular importance if the EO data processing should be executed near the data. For example, the data observation and scheduling components could run in a self-hosted environment while the EO processing tool components (i.e. WPS + tool backend) are deployed on e.g. CODE-DE."

It is suitable to run on IaaS or PaaS (e.g. CODE-DE or Copernicus DIAS nodes) as well as dedicated environments such as Kubernetes clusters. Future work will focus on the system’s usability aspects. A dedicated browser-based application will be developed for managing the different processing jobs. Several improvements in the component architecture (e.g. EO tool and product catalog) will support these developments."

So, Apple hired Guy Kawasaki to promote the Macintosh, persuade these developers to join the Apple community and get them to develop new software and hardware. Well, we know how it turned out.

It is also very different from traditional marketing — instead of getting the customers to buy what you sell, evangelism focuses on getting the customers to believe what you sell.

Very few people are willing to reinvent the wheel and even fewer, to pay for it. Apple made the mistake with the later versions of Macintosh, asking early customers to completely overhaul their IT infrastructure (powered by IBM at that time), telling them that the new Macintosh would revolutionise computing and change their world. By the time Apple learnt the lesson to simplify their pitch, Microsoft would successfully develop a similar GUI-based operating system (Windows), simplify two problems — word processing and spreadsheet calculations, develop the Microsoft Office Suite and become the most popular computer in the world."

Although, I personally believe that EO will be revolutionary as we move towards a big data economy, I find myself constantly reminding myself that this is a consequence and not the goal. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that people just want to know how EO can make things better for them, and perhaps, allow them to take a “first safe step”, towards making an investment. An evangelising approach seems appropriate for an emerging, less-understood technology like EO. Perhaps, it’s too early for the traditional sales and marketing approach."

But, how do we do it? Should HR be looking to hire evangelists? Should the marketing team develop specific content for evangelising EO? Should the business development and sales executives focus on an evangelising approach to selling EO data and products? Or, should everyone in a company be evangelistic? I am not sure if there is one right answer. From Apple’s case, it’s clear that it’s not only possible to successfully sell (seemingly) new, complex and innovative technology, but also acquire millions of followers and become a religion. Every religion has its evangelists and EO needs them too — to just bring the good news!"

If you want to get technical it’s 1.0-beta.1, which means that everything is not yet completely locked in. And it’s just the core specs, as we’ve split off the STAC API into its own repository, and its 1.0-beta.1 release will follow. But this is a huge milestone, as it symbolizes that the community has worked through every known issue and desired improvement. It is the beginning of the final stabilization steps, to ensure STAC will be a stable core that people can build on for years and even decades to come."

The goal between beta.1 and 1.0.0 is to update every piece of software that has implemented STAC, as well as upgrade all the existing STAC Catalogs to the latest, so we are sure our changes work for everyone. And then we will also be doing a big push to diverse data providers to get them to try out the latest and make sure it works for them. If something is unaccounted for or off then we can still make some final tweaks, which we really do not want to do after 1.0.0."

It always felt a bit different than the core STAC JSON specifications, as it takes the STAC content model and fits it into the OGC Features API, adding a few extensions of interest to the STAC community. So putting it in its own repository enables it to follow its own release schedule, tracking both STAC core and OGC Features API (and its extensions) as dependencies. We’re hoping that STAC API 1.0-beta.1 will follow in a month or two."

The first started with people in the Open Data Cube community, who wanted to be able to use STAC to populate their catalog without having to open every single file. They proposed a ‘grids extension’, but it ended up evolving to a more general solution. One part of the solution was adding proj:shape and proj:transform to the Projection Extension. Combining these with the projection information enables the creation of ‘virtual rasters’ (like GDAL VRT’s), enabling users to treat a set of STAC Items as a single asset."

That was to add the ability to incorporate additional fields for assets, using fields from the ‘properties’ section of an Item to its individual assets. This lets an asset provide more detailed info than is available at the collection level. For example the ‘gsd’ (resolution) of many satellites is actually different depending on the band, and the bands are available as individual assets, so you can now specify the gsd of each band, in addition to providing the ‘best’ gsd at the Item level. The big caveat with using this construction is that most clients searching STAC Catalogs won’t be able to use it, so the recommendation is still to use the Item properties as much as possible. We put into the best practices document some examples of cases where it likely makes sense to use the asset fields."

They have been inspired by STAC but felt it didn’t quite fit the shape of their data, so created the ESM Collection spec that was similar to STAC. We had some good discussions in our repo and theirs, and even held a mini ‘sprint’ to push forward. The result is that ESM will be a STAC extension, and the STAC core has had a few tweaks. The main one is more flexibility on the time fields, so that multi-dimensional data cubes that span decades aren’t forced to pick a single datetime, they can set it a null and then must use the start_datetime and end_datetime fields in the Common Metadata to define a time range (see the datetime selection best practice for more information)."

Their use case was to be able to make metadata assets available at the collection level, OpenEO is adding thumbnails of collections, and the zarr assets make much more sense at a collection level. This is starting as an extension, to gauge wider uptake, but is a good candidate to evolve into the core."

The first is the timestamps extension, which adds published, expires, and unpublished to the core created and updated fields. And these now take advantage of the new ability to add fields for assets, by using the same fields, but having their meaning depend on if they are applied at the item (properties) level or at an asset level. So the whole item can be published at one time, but individual assets can have their own published timestamps."

These can make sense as a single STAC ‘Item’, but can have thousands of individual files as the data is so large that it makes sense to split it up. A common approach to global mosaics is to split them into a regular grid of COG’s, and so the tiled asset extension makes it much easier to include those in STAC. The resulting catalogs can then be read directly by COG-aware clients like COG Explorer, or used to power compositing tile servers."

So there have been a few things we removed. The biggest was the Commons extension, which was a cool construction to enable items not to have to repeat a field that was the same in every single one. But as STAC evolved there was a need to provide an overview of all fields in the collection, not just the common ones. So the ‘summary’ construct was added. This ended up handling many of the common use cases, and with a few tweaks to how the EO bands object is handled, we were able to remove it. We also removed a number of the warnings in the spec about how it is unstable since we are moving towards stability. The ‘how to help’ document was also removed since it was quite outdated, and we are working to find a good home for that type of information. And the ‘implementations’ list was migrated to stacspec.org, as it was a bit weird to have specification releases include a list of implementations that would always be out of date (since they need the spec released to implement)."

An overview was added to paint the full picture of what a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog is and explain how the 3 sub-specifications fit together into a coherent whole. The best practices document had a number of additions. It is shaping up to be a very nice aspect of the specification — we want the core to be flexible, but we also want to guide new users towards things the community has figured out. So the best practices is a great place to put informative learnings without having to bulk up the main spec documents. There was also lots of minor cleanups, consolidating some of the documents so that people don’t have to get their head around so much at once."

The goal is to really focus on updating all the existing catalogs and software to 1.0-beta.1, encouraging as many new implementations as possible so that we are sure the specification is really solid. We will likely organize a virtual sprint as soon as we have some of the core tools (STAC Browser, PySTAC, etc) up to date.

In India, a significant majority (>90%) of wildfires originate from human activity such as timber harvesting, land conversion, slash-and-burn agriculture and socio-economic conflicts over land-use and property rights (Roy, 2003). However, in recent years extended conditions of drought, overexploitation for commercial purpose and conversion for other land-use has led to a considerable increase in wildfire size, frequency and associated environmental impacts. The losses reported by the government authorities are often underestimated. They are derived from the ground survey studies and field observations made by the Forest Survey of India (FSI). Due to the absence of quality statistical data on forest fire size, and total affected area, the extent of destruction caused by forest fires cannot be accurately estimated. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have made it possible to overcome such limitations in a cost-effective and timely manner by providing deep-level insights about the dynamics of response in forest ecosystems. Thus, our ability to detect, monitor, assess and predict fires at a global, regional and local scale has significantly improved."

The first instance of wildfire was reported on 21st February in the Kundakere range of the park, which then spread rapidly to nearby ranges due to strong winds. Reports suggest that the five-day-long wildfire was sparked by humans living in the vicinity of the national park. The preceding dry monsoon spell left plenty of flammable material in the under-story of the forest ranges. While wildfires are not uncommon in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and national park, the undergrowth which is mainly made of Lantana Camara, an invasive weed species, might have played a role in worsening the intensity and speed of fires."

However, reports [1] have claimed that officials misreported the estimates to downplay the damage by the fires. For an accurate damage assessment of the 2019 Bandipur wildfires, earth observation satellites can provide valuable insight with regards to the extent and severity of the fires. This article reports on three key aspects — a) identification of fire-affected areas, b) classification of burn severity, and c) estimation of the total fire-affected area using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite data."

These spectral signatures allow us to examine a wide variety of terrestrial processes. Optical remote sensing tools utilize the visible and infrared sensors located on high-resolution earth observation satellites for studying forest fires. The near-infrared, mid-infrared and thermal bands are susceptible to changes in vegetation health. They are frequently used for an accurate evaluation of fire-affected areas and burn severity to support forest management activities. Green, healthy vegetation reflects radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) region. It absorbs red light in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Meanwhile, burn-affected areas expend more energy in the visible and shortwave infrared (SWIR) region while absorbing energy in the NIR region (figure 2)."

It is calculated using the energy intensity from the NIR and SWIR wavelength bands from the remotely sensed satellite imagery. The formula for NBR is similar to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is based on the intensity of light coming from NIR and red wavelength bands. NBR uses the ratio between NIR and SWIR bands. High NBR values reflect areas covered with healthy vegetation, whereas low values indicate bare ground and recently burned areas. Near-zero values represent areas that are not affected by the fire event."

It is estimated as the difference between pre-fire and post-fire NBR derived from satellite images. To identify recently burned areas and differentiate them from bare soil and other non-vegetated areas, the difference between pre-fire and post-fire NBR, also known as the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index is frequently used. Areas with high dNBR value correspond to a higher degree of damage or burn severity. In contrast, low dNBR values represent areas that are unaffected from the fire event or regions that have rebounded via regrowth of plant species following a wildfire incident."

The image acquired closest in time to the fire event is termed the master image and the one most recently after as the slave image. By computing the NBR for the master image and subsequent slave images, the impact of fires can be analyzed [2]. Based on the difference between the master NBR image and slave NBR image (dNBR), the total burned area of the fire event can be determined, and areas impacted heavily by the fires can be delineated. Each subsequent slave image can be used to create a post-fire map at different points in time from the first fire map (master) and monitor the recovery progress by examining the response of the forest vegetation."

It consists of two satellites equipped with a state-of-the-art Multispectral Imager (MSI) that provides high-resolution optical imagery via 13 spectral bands at a global scale with a high revisit frequency rendering it a vital data source for land use land cover monitoring, atmospheric correction and cloud/snow separation (ESA). The Sentinel 2 Level 2B (L2B) data used in this analysis has been acquired from the Copernicus Open Access Hub. For developing the post-fire assessment map, two images obtained 10-days apart on 18 February 2019, i.e., master and 28 February 2019, i.e., slave are used (figure 3). The two satellite images have been pre-processed using the SNAP Desktop GUI which is developed on top of the SNAP Engine and is based on the NetBeans Platform. Developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), SNAP is a common software platform used for the scientific exploitation of the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions. The project page of SNAP and the individual toolboxes can be found at http://step.esa.int."

It is especially important when the analysis involves comparing satellite data at two different times for the same area. All Sentinel 2 L2 products available since April 2017 have had atmospheric correction already applied to them. The L2B product contains vector cloud and cirrus masks, which are created as a product of the atmospheric correction, however, applying the mask on all bands and the full scene is time-consuming. We, therefore, subset the product, but the vector products are lost by that operation. So, in our case, to preserve the information, a new band containing the cloud mask must be created. This is currently not possible to do using a batch processing method, so we need to add the cloud mask band to each product separately before using the GraphBuilder tool for pre-processing."

We can use the Batch Processing tool available in SNAP to process all images at the same time. To use the tool, we first need to define the process we want to apply and all its steps. We can do this using the GraphBuilder tool. Another advantage of batch processing in GraphBuilder is that only the final product is physically saved, saving valuable disk space. A brief summary of the pre-processing workflow (figure 4) in GraphBuilder GUI is outlined below."

This task of juxtaposing the two spatially overlapping images using the Collocation Tool in SNAP allows us later to easily calculate the change in the pre- and post-fire NBR values. Before the change can be detected, however, we need to mask out the water bodies and clouds from the newly created image."

However, the index is sensitive to water bodies, and this can cause misclassification of image pixels. Lakes and rivers can show similar differences in NBR values in some cases and lead to false positives scenarios [3], i.e., pixels being classified as burned when they are actually not. It is, therefore, necessary to mask out pixels that represent water bodies, which can be detected using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). For this purpose, we will create a single combined water and cloud mask. The NDWI is designed to maximize the reflectance of the water body in the green band and minimize the reflectance of a water body in the NIR band [McFeeters, 1996]."

To identify recently burned areas, dNBR can be calculated by differencing the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR. However, dNBR is an absolute measure of change, which can lead to issues in areas with low pre-fire vegetation cover, where the difference will be insignificant. To avoid such problems, we use the relativized burn ratio (RBR):"

Once RBR has been calculated, we can use BandMaths tool to identify recently burned areas by creating a new band that will only contain pixels that have RBR values above a specified threshold. We can visualize the change in RBR values, which as we have established is the measure used for burn area assessment, by plotting the RBR band using either a GIS software like QGIS. Here, I have used Python to plot a map of RBR values (figure 5) using a suitable colormap and scale based on the range within which the RBR values lie. A histogram plot is a quick way to assess the range in which most of the RBR values lie. For our dataset, the RBR values lie mostly between -0.25 and 0.6, so I have used a range from -0.75 and 0.75 to create the change detection map."

Classification of burn severity can serve as an essential tool in aiding emergency efforts and assessing post-fire rehabilitation development. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has proposed a classification table to interpret the burn severity, which can be seen in the table below."

Some areas of the forest have RBR values that correspond to vegetative regrowth. Majority of the pixels in the dataset have a value close to 0 (mean value is 0.06) which corresponds to unburned areas. The burn scar showing fire-affected areas is clearly visible (figure 6) and is demonstrated by pixels with RBR values above 0.1. Within the affected area, quite a large number of pixels have been classified to a low severity burn zone. This might be caused by the time difference between two images. This time of the year is relatively dry, and some vegetation might have degraded, leading to magnitude of change in RBR values similar to a low severity burn."

Based on this threshold, the total burned area can be calculated as simply the area occupied by the all of the pixels multiplied by the resolution in the horizontal (longitude) and vertical (latitude) axes. To calculate the total burned area in our study region, we use the following formula:"

Satellites provide a cost-effective method of monitoring large-scale fires. In recent years, increased availability of mid- to high spatial resolution data optical satellite data from earth observation remote sensing missions have allowed researchers and fire management officials to carry out a detailed post-fire assessment. This article showcases the utility of normalized burn ratio (NBR) as a useful index for delineating fire-affected areas and burn area assessment using data from the Sentinel 2 mission. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS techniques can provide vital insight into the impact of wildfires on forest ecosystems. This has important implications for effective monitoring, planning and potential prevention management of large-scale forest fires worldwide."

The computer vision model can automatically generate semantic maps of a large area from EO data [Audebert2017a]. The resulting semantic maps can be used for the cartography of urban areas or to determine land use cover at a massive scale. In change detection, machine learning models could be used to extend the semantic analysis of EO data by incorporating the multi-temporal dimension. This enables us to track changes around the globe or monitor activity in high-revisit rate acquisitions. It also plays an essential role in the production of maps depicting the evolutions of land use, urban coverage, deforestation, and other multi-temporal type analysis. The image retrieval aims to retrieve images with similar visual contents with respect to the query image from a database."

This is because compared to other types of Data, EO presents several challenges for machine learning algorithms. The following video discusses some of the opportunities and challenges of machine learning for EO."
AI4EO-An Opportunity for Computation Sustainability,https://medium.com/ai4eo-an-opportunity-for-computation-sustainabilit/ai4eo-an-opportunity-for-computation-sustainability-88cd17a623db?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,https://medium.com/@sskulki,Medium,23,"First, the EO data is multimodal and high dimensional. For instance, the EO satellite data come from a variety of sensors types such as passive sensors (RBGN), active sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)), near-infrared sensors. The data also contain additional geo-related data like weather, geo-physical or biochemical quantities and other derived products. This data variety raises the following fundamental challenges when applied to the machine learning model: *how to combine all these data types (data fusion) since all these sources provide complementary information that should be used jointly to maximize the model’s performance. As a result, there is a need to develop novel machine learning models that match EO data taken from different sources with different imaging modalities. Modifying existing vision-based deep networks to these data is not trivial, as this requires to work with new data structures that do not share the same underlying physical and numerical properties. Other exciting topics could be investigating the transferability of deep learning networks to [EO imaging modalities] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8113128). Among the other challenges are the sheer number of pixels and the geographic extent per image. For example, a single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses > 64 km2 and over 250 million pixels. Also, the objects of interest are microscopic, which complicates traditional computer vision techniques."

Besides, these data contain plenty of unlabelled data, making it challenging to use well-established supervised machine learning techniques. Yet this provides an opportunity to explore the recent progress in semi-supervised learning, self-supervised, and active-learning methods for EO application. Furthermore, the existence of meta-data and other geo-referenced data such as the Open-street map (OSM) provides an opportunity for creating annotated satellite imagery data for machine learning algorithms."

For example, to estimate crop yield from EO, one needs to collect large samples of yield estimates within identified fields and then use satellite imagery and ML techniques to predict crop yield in nearby and adjacent regions. The collection of ground-referenced data is time-consuming and expensive. However, research centers around the world conduct fieldwork and collect data regularly. Although these data are not collected for ML purposes, with proper georeferencing, they can be used to create training datasets with minimal effort. If properly coordinated and collected there is tremendous opportunity to put this data to work in ML on EO applications."

They are known as the Murray, and Simmons ice caps Scientists from NSIDC have predicted their demise too."

Farm size says very little about who they are or how well they know their business. Calling them “smallholders” is an oversimplification of what is a vast universe of different forms of production with diverse needs, constraints and opportunities. In a time of greater volatility, it’s good business to know more about the farmers you work with. As sustainability initiatives continue to evolve into risk management strategies, data is king."

Large distances and the highly atomised nature of coffee production makes it difficult (and expensive) to collect reliable information. But maybe times are changing. New scientific and technological advances make it more reasonable to bypass these challenges. Satellite earth observation combined with AI and Machine Learning could be used to provide insight into coffee production as is already happening in other commodity value chains. For those non-technical readers, the relationship between the sun, vegetation and electromagnetic radiation is one of nature’s most abundant data sources (don’t panic, do not want you to relive any traumas from high school physics)."

These are signals of different radiation wavelengths reflected from vegetation and key crop characteristics, such as structure, phenological stage, vegetation density, production system, spatial orientation and soil effects. As has been shown in scientific publications relating to coffee and other crops, vegetation indices are sensitive to phenological changes and correlate with agricultural productivity. So no matter how information scarce or hard to reach a coffee farm might be, (from space) coffee trees are always emitting data. And lot’s of it."

It is a perennial crop that will remain on a landscape for around 10 years, it will be hard to distinguish from other forms of vegetation in shaded productions systems, and last (but not least) coffee grows in cloud-prone tropical regions of the world. Some initiatives predicate the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to see through clouds, but coffee can also grow in rough terrain making SAR-based satellite observations very difficult. A few years ago this was indeed the nightmare scenario for remote sensing scientists. Fortunately advances in satellite technology (more types of satellites, more data density), Machine Learning algorithms and a growing community of practice, barriers to innovation are dropping fast."

In an exploratory Proof of Concept (PoC) with Neumann Kaffee Gruppe’s NKG Bloom, we were provided with a set of anonymous 26 GPS polygons of small coffee farms that are part of their innovative microfinance program. Looking to set the foundations to “statistically score” coffee farms and reduce the cost of service delivery, our goal was to test freely accessible remote sensing images and standard vegetation indexes to determine a novel way to remotely qualify and segment farm potential."

To interpret the data, a “blind test” or Unsupervised Characterization of the polygons was implemented. Since the polygons were anonymous with no additional information (e.g. historical productivity), an unsupervised “blind test” involves the generation of insights based on the relationship between random items in a group. For example, it is generally expected that more qualified farmers will follow well structured growing patterns, while less experienced farmers are less organized in the tilling of farms. An unsupervised characterization might detect these patterns and automatically classify polygons on this and other features it deems statistically significant."

The Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) was selected for analysis because it captures the spectral behavior of both vegetation and soil background better than other indices. From each polygon, the mean SAVI, coefficient of variation (%CV) and farm area were extracted and used to rank the polygons. Our hypothesis was that to remotely qualify and segment farm potential, good coffee farms should have a high SAVI (indicating vegetation density or plant vigour), a low %CV in SAVI (indicating farm uniformity) and a larger farm area. A hierarchical clustering method was applied to group polygons into clusters based on their similarity indicative of potential/condition. The algorithm starts by treating each polygon as a singleton cluster then pairs it with the closest similar until all clusters have been merged into groups and ranked. The results divided the 26 polygons into 4 groups and a simple classification system was developed to score polygons and their respective farmers as Very Good, Good, Average and Poor."

In the absence of productivity data, the resulting classification system was compared to NKG Bloom’s “credit limit” per selected farm and achieved a positive correlation is 0.354579. In other words, farm spectral behavior could remotely predict up to a third of the way the likelihood of farmer potential. Not too bad but not good enough to build a statistically significant predictor to segment and classify small coffee farms. More data is necessary! Furthermore, interesting challenges were identified as part of the development roadmap. Given the closeness to the Equator, satellite observation of coffee production must always account for removing the effects of the atmosphere on reflectance values, weaknesses in cloud detection and low availability of cloud-free images. There are modern approaches to compensate for this but we believe there are simpler ways to circumvent this challenge with a basic understanding of coffee agronomy and few good images at key points of the harvesting cycle. Integrating such methods will harmonize multi-temporal time series data, which will offer more powerful interpretative value over image analysis based on a single scene."

Despite the efforts of sustainability certifications and verification schemes for the past 30 years, the world’s favorite beverage is in peril. The systemic inability for coffee farming to access financial services is a sizable elephant in your favorite coffee shop. While 65% of global production depends on smallholder farms that are less than 20 hectares, we estimate less than 10% of smallholders access formal financial services. Why is this a problem? Because it leaves the majority of coffee production unable to access seasonal inputs, upgrade farm capacity and make the necessary short- and long-term investments to remain competitive and raise global productivity sustainably."
"Farmer bankability, sustainability and the elephant in the coffee shop",https://medium.com/@VinculumAI/farmer-bankability-sustainability-and-the-elephant-in-the-coffee-shop-2f7dd85183c4?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,https://medium.com/@VinculumAI,Medium,2,"As we continue to see the effects of COVID-19 across the industry, investing in good farmers is more important than ever. Currently, an overwhelming majority of farmers do not have the financial tools and services to sustain market volatility and a lack of financing is accelerating a downward productivity cycle at a global scale (see figure below). To put it starkly, 4 million hectares of smallholder farmlands are past their productivity peak and require capital to renovate aging coffee trees (this is equivalent to the harvested area of the world’s 4 top producers: Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia and Ethiopia). Furthermore, climate change is only making the future more uncertain. It is estimated suitable land for coffee will decrease 50% by 2050 due to climate change, while coffee production will need to increase by 2x or more to meet future demand. To face these industry challenges, a significant flow of capital must shift toward sustainable coffee production that benefits smallholder farmers to avoid billions of dollars in lost revenue and higher costs for the industry."
"Farmer bankability, sustainability and the elephant in the coffee shop",https://medium.com/@VinculumAI/farmer-bankability-sustainability-and-the-elephant-in-the-coffee-shop-2f7dd85183c4?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,https://medium.com/@VinculumAI,Medium,3,"Improving the “bankability” of smallholder coffee farming is the new sustainability frontier. Climate change, price volatility and a supply chain that still lives in the 1960’s make it clear that the traditional approaches to sustainability (price premiums, traceability and strong farmer organizations) are important but not enough for the scale of the challenge. Farmers must first accomplish business sustainability and financing is key. A farmer with consistent and timely access to seasonal working capital and risk management tools is more able to invest in sustainable production. Implementing climate-resistant coffee varieties, agroforestry or organic inputs is not free but increasingly feasible if a farm’s financial liquidity does not compete with basic food security or sending farmer’s children to school. To achieve greater financial inclusion of smallholder farmers, a new sustainability vision is required to provide reliable data at a massive scale."

On a fundamental level, bankability is a globally transferable indicator that makes smallholder farms comparable (e.g. What is their cost of production? Are they making a living wage? etc). It is a baseline that requires a simple language (or universal data model) to describe a farmer’s experience and production potential in relation to the state of the market and agri-climatic risk. In aggregation this information can provide significant insight into coffee landscapes and new kinds of data-driven farmer services based on evidence, objective decision-making and trustworthy data. So this goes way beyond giving loans to farmers. And creating the intelligence and governance behind this process will be a game changer for the industry."

Over the past decade the topic of bankability and risk management is being reinvented with Data Science and an explosion of new data sources. Alternative credit scoring is a perfect example of new and successful ways of determining credit risk for people with little to no banking history. Fortunately, applications in agriculture or “agri-fintech” is a quickly evolving field in emerging countries with notable examples such as Apollo Agriculture in Kenya and Impact Terra in Myanmar. Coffee has some strong foundations for innovation and thanks to climate change research, we have initial frameworks on how to identify at-risk regions, perform resilience planning and direct long-term investments. But how can we take these large-scale landscape approaches toward farm-based insights? We believe novel developments in Artificial Intelligence applied to satellite observation and agro-meteorology can begin to answer this question and provide the foundations or the “plumbing” for a new generation of bankability solutions."

The innate characteristics of satellite data (large volumes of globally comparable data!) and cloud computing are beginning to show us a glimpse of the future. Thanks to our partnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), we have access to a global database of coffee farm GPS locations and are exploring the use of geospatial computer vision and other approaches to detect, evaluate and monitor smallholder coffee farms. Currently, we have been able to detect coffee farms in El Salvador and “score” the agri-climatic suitability for coffee at a 100 meter resolution with +85% accuracy (the current standard is 1 km resolution). Agri-climatic suitability at a greater spatial resolution allows us to quantify environmental risk and quickly diagnose smaller pieces of land with regard to limiting productivity factors such as soil and climate patterns specific to a location. These are promising results but transforming these technical developments into simple tools and applications for smallholder farmers is our greatest challenge."

For the past few years we have been on a learning voyage to understand how science, technology and finance can help the coffee industry reach its sustainability commitments and shine some much needed light toward the first-mile of the coffee value chain. Despite the growing influence of farm-level data collection, impact measurement and traceability systems in new sustainability initiatives and industry platforms, bankability or financial inclusion is seldom spoken about. We hope to change that. Our voyage has taken us through various exploratory projects with leading actors in coffee and financial services across Nicaragua, Uganda, El Salvador and now in Colombia. In hope to spark the conversation on farmer bankability, we plan to share our lessons, insights and passion for the subject in a series of blogs that we will publish over the coming weeks.

It is also forcing us to prioritise our ideas. That being said, such a writing usually takes quite some time and it often happens that things change in the interim…Before talking about the future, let’s see what we have done in the past and how we see the overall situation in the field at the moment."

Expanding the Universe of Cloud API for EO Data,https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/expanding-the-universe-of-cloud-api-for-eo-data-aca8ae60f28a?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,https://medium.com/@grega.milcinski,Medium,4,"Another amazing activity in 2019 was seeing new users coming in. This is especially cool due to the fact that our marketing is not our strongest point. Our past company’s experience focused to large scale individual projects so we lack expertise in addressing masses. Our web-site, Twitter and this blog are more or less the only elements, missing various promotion campaigns, SEO, adwords et al. Well, there is also the EO Browser, used by hundreds of thousands of people. Its prime objective was to showcase what can be built on top of our services. It has however proved to be an essential tool to raise awareness of the EO data. It’s such a joy to look how non-experts come up with new interesting observations all around the world."

What makes us super happy is seeing the well-established remote sensing experts, companies and research institutes, integrating our services in their workflows. These are power users, who have similar capabilities, feature-wise, available internally. Yet they decide to use Sentinel Hub as they have realised the efficiency, cost wise and, probably more importantly, effort wise, so that they can focus their knowhow to building added value services."
Expanding the Universe of Cloud API for EO Data,https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/expanding-the-universe-of-cloud-api-for-eo-data-aca8ae60f28a?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,https://medium.com/@grega.milcinski,Medium,6,"The presentWe have to admit that when launching Sentinel Hub a few years ago, we’ve had no grand vision for the future. We simply thought this is a cool idea and pushed it on. Then we started to work on new features, various ones, trying to take care on remaining focused. And things neatly fell in the place.Sentinel Hub was always oriented to empowering other developers to work with EO data more efficiently. We’ve always believed that added value generation will happen somewhere else — in 3rd party web application, in Python script running on users’ VMs and similar. Therefore, the user interface to our services was never that important. However, after building and operating EO Browser for a while, initially an idea by European Space Agency (ESA), we have noticed that it is bringing added value, not just promotion, both to our subscribers as well as to the general community. People use it to develop and test new EO algorithms, to find relevant data and to monitor, what’s happening with our planet. Another important evolution, which happened by chance, was integration of Sentinel Hub into “Euro Data Cube”, a project initiated by ESA. There, our partners added two very important services — integration with xcube, which allows xarray based data analysis, so much favoured by data scientists, and hosted processing in Jupyter Lab. Suddenly, Sentinel Hub is no longer just an API but also part of the facility supporting user doing just about anything that they want. It suddenly has, combining all elements, similar capabilities"

None of these is sharing any information about the usage so it’s difficult to say where we are in this group, but with hundreds of millions of requests being processed every month and a sustainable business model we feel quite comfortable and certain about long-term prospects. The main competition are probably not other service providers but rather open-source initiatives from Development Seed, Azavea, Astraea and others, which are making it simpler to build the workflows by oneself. Still, there is effort needed to set-up and maintain these things, as well as the related ICT costs. We therefore believe that the added value that our service provides, outweighs the costs of operation. This might not have been the case for large scale processing but with the introduction of Batch, essentially reducing the cost by a factor of three, it’s again a decent value proposition."

There are errors found, scalability issues that cannot be solved by simply adding new virtual machines, the input data changing. Therefore, significant part of our future will simply be occupied by making sure that our services work well. Perhaps this effort is not easily visible, but it adds a tremendous value to our users as this means they do not need to worry about it — they can focus to building steps down the line, to create even better product on their end. In the past year we’ve put a lot of effort into automation of this so that we can still get our eyes off the infrastructure and back to the code, to address the plans for the coming year:"

Additionally, we partner with ESRI Bulgaria in several projects and have hired the company to provide specialized tutorials for advanced GIS features, related to our R&D projects in cultural heritage. Further, we develop together with ESRI Bulgaria and SISTEMA GmbH (the provider of ADAM Platform) integrated solutions in distributed software architectures combining processing, search and display of numeric, symbolic, geospatial and earth observation data in a synchronized manner. To achieve this, our software engineers and architects work closely with ESRI Bulgaria’s GIS experts to design and develop technical integration. This ensures a strong transfer of knowledge related to GIS. Our collaboration with SISTEMA ensures, on the other hand, knowledge transfer regarding satellite data access, management, description and use. SISTEMA GmbH, via the ADAM platform, supplies our solutions with satellite data from different satellites depending on our needs and enables us to be satellite agnostic. Our dam monitoring and water resources management solution is integrated with the ADAM Platform and harvests meteorological data from satellites to display on a GIS component and to use to train AI algorithms for producing forecasts about the expected water volumes and levels.
